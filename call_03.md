## Intro  [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE)

**Mark:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to xyzDAO project call, number three. 

Yeah, that's right. We are calling it xyzDAO now. The elephant in the room– we are switching up the branding on everyone. We are sticking with Universe. I'll let Tyler go over some of these changes new branding changes. They were almost necessary. Tyler can explain why in a little more detail why we had to make those switches. 

## Branding Changes  [[00:27]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=27)

**Tyler:** The highest level thing, there is another project called kekToken. It's a DeFi project that is getting a relative amount of hype. I don't want the same situation that happened with BOND is BarnBridge. 

In that scenario, we had the token ticker first. And we talked with other teams that came out after us and wanted to use the BOND ticker. One of them tried to vampire attack us, and It's been a pain in the ass. Coinbase wallet shows the wrong BOND, a couple of people have also bought the incorrect BOND. And entered our Discord and complained about it.

So, out of respect for this other kekToken, it's not a massive project. But, I respect other teams that are building, and they didn't know about us. I think it existed before we started calling ourselves kekDAO. 

**Mark:** It looks like it launched around December 2020– so it's about four or five months old. 

**Tyler:** A big thing is giving respect to that team. It's the right thing to do. Aside from that, it's a better and an easy decision to make. Some of the people in our Telegram threads and the others I talk with, there are so many names. It started as one thing, and now it's kekDAO. And it powers Universe and Universe is "Non-fungible Universe" and Universe.XYZ is the website. 

### Kek->XYZ  [[02:15]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=135)

So, we decided that the domain name will remain [Universe.xyz](https://universe.xyz)

It's a lot easier. We went through a couple of different names. We had internal votes, and we think XYZ is a cool name for the token. There is nothing that gets used in that capacity. I believe there is one on Stellar. But it's not on Ethereum. So, we wouldn't have wallet issues or anything of that nature. Also, the project is dead. It was a 2017 ICO, and there has been nothing on their Github etc. 

As of right now, we are the only XYZ token. So, I think it will be easy for people to know what the correct token is. We don't have to get into XYZ's Universe. Unless someone vampire attacks our token name as they did with BarnBridge, however, it's not our fault. We are not responsible for that. In that scenario, there is nothing we can do to stop it.

It keeps things easy for the community and for new people who come in. Some of our seed investors, contributors and core team are getting caught up in this tongue twister of all these different names. So, we truncated everything to Universe.XYZ.

You can call it:

- Universe
- Universe.XYZ
- xyzDAO

Also, there the XYZ token. All the different moving parts are a lot more straightforward.

**Mark:** I also think it sounds a bit better. It's more exciting. XYZ is cool. 

**Tyler:** Yeah, and honestly, it's getting into the media side. The whole thing around "kek." I'm a big believer that it's not a racist term. I did more research– it started from a Korean keyboard. Because they could not type 'LOL' as it would come out as 'kek.' So, in international gaming communities, "kek" literally means laugh out loud. I'm not sure of when it became racist. 

There is still that vibe with our project that you cannot be racist and taking back some of the things that were essentially taken from us by people doing wrong things. Like internet memeology as we have started to work with higher and higher groups. And as NFTs get more prominent. 

I don't want to offend someone off the rip and not get to work with some groups. Because they inherently view it negatively, and that's not our intention. I think, moving on from our original origins and having a more buttoned-up approach at the jump. It's probably better for the project as a whole. It wasn't a decision we wanted to make– it set us back a bit. There was a ton of branding work, and we had to redo a ton of stuff. It was not a light lift. But at the end of the day, there are way more reasons to make these changes than to not. And honestly, the end result's dope, in my opinion. I agree with Mark.

**Mark:** Yeah, and about the branding. We have finally gotten everything switched over. We were hoping to launch the website this week. However, with the branding setbacks, it's looking like it will be launched sometime next week. 

**Tyler:** Yep!

## Documentation  [[06:07]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=367)

### Website

**Mark:** Also, with the website, that's almost done. Our main setback is the branding changes. So, expect us to make announcements next week, and we'll be pushing it live soon. 

We still need to fix a few in-between things. There are always some things that don't work right and need to be adjusted. 

### Whitepaper

**Troy:** I think the most important thing, Mark, is the documents. 

Don't forget the community always asks they need to see the docs. 

**Mark:** That's one of the main things we were waiting for– before launching the site. We're getting the docs finalized so when the site launches, everyone has access to the docs and can finally read them. 

**Troy:** Gotta read the docs, man! We need the docs. The docs must get released. 

**Mark:** Would you like to talk a bit about the docs?

### Timelines  [[07:05]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=426)

**Troy:** Yeah, so, the documents are ready. 

But, we are not ready to release them just yet. We are going to need a couple of days. We have them, they're secured, they're ready to go. But you are not getting them just yet. But, they're coming!


All jokes aside– the documents have been signed off by the lawyers. We are ready to put it out. We are waiting for some of the images that go into it. So it's an official release. So, expect it to launch with the website. Likely in the latter half of next week. 

So, the documents are secured.

**Mark:** That's exciting news. 

**Tyler:** Now people will be asking about Blueprints in the Discord. 

**Troy:** That's alright, we got Blueprints coming too. 

**Tyler:** Show me the Blueprints. 😂

## Distribution of XYZ  [[08:12]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=492)

**Mark:** One other thing we want to mention today the token name is changing and the branding– so we would like to talk a bit about the distribution of the XYZ token. 

So, Dragos and Troy. Can you talk a bit about how Yield farming and distribution will work? 

**Dragos:** We're going ahead with the Yield farming and the DAO for distribution. I also think there are going to be some airdrops. I don't want to talk much about that. Troy, would you like to take that topic?

**Tyler:** I can take this. I believe I may have the most clarity on this. 

### Airdrops [[09:11]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=551)

**Tyler:** I think we said the name of the tokens last week that we were launching with for yield farming, for token distribution. A lot of it is aligning ourselves with deeper DeFi communities, putting up specific tokens so that people can be involved with the project. The airdrop details were talked about on the first calls– via Discord –when we launched everything. 

What I'll say about the airdrops. There are two separate drops:

1. Community Discretionary 
   - Around 100 people helped the project along the way.
  
2. Core/OG Contributors (re-seeded the project)
   - People who put up Ether. Helped launch the community, the core team and the people who re-seeded the project.

We are separating airdrops from contributors because all contributor stuff gets done via vesting contracts. The airdrop stuff, instead of vesting contracts. I talked with Andrey from [Opium](https://www.opium.network/). (a new and up & coming DeFi protocol)

Essentially, when they launch their tokens on the DeFi sites. One thing they did to reward early-stage supporters– it was slightly a chicken and the egg. They helped over a three or four-month period. And then they may have gotten involved with other things. So, when we drop all of these out. We don't want an immediate scenario where people do not understand. There is a ton of game theory that goes into this. Long story short, they dropped a thing called Dr. Opium. 

It's all open-source, similar to our yield farming contracts and DAO contracts. It's not a huge lift. It's getting looked at, but we are not 100% sure. We need to make sure there's not a major lift or build that needs to get done. They've gotten audited, and tons of money has gone through the Dr. Opium contracts. They're safe in that capacity. 

So, you earmark wallets that are eligible for the airdrop. Which not only tells you how much they are getting but also who is getting them. There are more than 100 people that helped– tons are in the Discord that we kept track of– they've hung around for a while waiting to see what's going to happen. 

The way Dr. Opium works: The first people who claim essentially get 'penalized' for being the first. The people who claim later get a bonus for waiting. 

I believe Andrey is a mathematical genius– Stani told me that he was at the top of his class for mathematics in Russia– coming out of high school. 

He has a bonding curve that he has built this thing on. 

So, let's say 3000 people are entitled to the airdrop. The 3000th person (last) will end up getting 2000% more tokens than the first person.

It's a mechanic for claiming: You can let it sit there or claim later for a better drop. 

The fun part about the game theory is Yield farming. Because you will be playing a game against the community while also gauging the yields from the available pools. (APY RATES)

Do I want to wait for an additional percentage from the drop? 

Or 

Do I claim now and stake in the pools? 

It will be a unique situation for each user. It's a fun way to handle how we are doing the airdrop. As opposed to airdropping to a bunch of people's wallets– it's not as fun. 


**Dragos:** Yep! So, that's the airdropping. 



### Yield Farming  [[14:30]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=870)

**Dragos:** For the Yield farming, we are launching with seven tokens. Should we say them?

**Tyler:** I think we said it before. It's not bad if we tell people. If people want to get into this, then it's good to know.

So, the answer is yes. 

**Dragos:** I have the list:

1. Aave
2. Bond
3. Comp
4. Synthetix
5. Sushi
6. Link
7. Illuvium

**Tyler:** Illuvium is an NFT project. It's done by Kain Warwicks, brothers. Aaron and Kieran. There's a funny joke about that; Kieran is Kain and Aaron sandwiched together– and he's the youngest. So, it's as if the parents gave up naming them and wedged them together.

Anyway, they launched an NFT game called Illuvium. And so, the Illuvium family and ecosystem are super supportive of the Universe. They are talking about doing a lot of their drops on there. 

And, it's a successful project already. They have raised 45 million in a Balancer IDO out of Australia. The original SPAC was around 5 million. They are well-capitalized, and they have a strong team. They're embedded in the Synthetix community. Kain has been quite successful in DeFi, and I believe his brothers will be successful in NFTs.

Not only is it a strategic move for Universe. But, the founders of that project have been super supportive of ours. It might be the one on the list that people are not fully aware of, so that's what it is. 

 **Dragos:** Awesome. We are also going to have a USDC/XYZ Sushi Liquid Pool. That's another way to get XYZ tokens. 

And the other way would be staking in the DAO. You will get rewards for staking there. 

Did I miss anything, Tyler? Or did I cover all the ways of distributing the token?

**Tyler:** Yeah, I think you nailed it. 

### Timelines  [[17:21]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=1041)

**Mark:** I have one question with timelines compared to BarnBridge.

I remember for Yield farming, we had to partially wait for the DAO to get finished– because audits were still taking place.

Are we going to launch the Governance and the DAO faster this time around? With BarnBridge, I believe it was about a month afterwards.

**Dragos:** That's a good question. The only thing that will come afterwards would be the Liquidity provider pool because you need a token first. (figured I should mention that)

In this case, we are going ahead with the DAO and yield farming. We are launching it together. 

I have a few comments on that topic as well. The rebranding was a slight setback because a few changes needed to get done. I enjoy the rebrand as well, so  I agree with you all. In this case, we are looking at the next few weeks to roll everything out. 

We've deployed things to the testnet, and we are running through everything and making sure things are ready for a smooth launch. 

Two weeks from now, it should be out. 

## The NFTS  [[18:52]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=1132)

**Mark:** Nice, that's so exciting, to be honest. It's been three months since we've minted an NFT. The last one was February 28th. So, thank you all for being so patient with us. It is the community sticking with us. It's getting exciting, and we want to get stuff in front of you guys– it's been three months. 

Honestly, the NFTs are looking sick. The update as of yesterday: We have two planets complete, done, and ready to mint. Meaning there are 46/69 characters entirely done. Al has finished the first of many comics. We have a lot of them written. One of them is complete and ready to go. It's exciting to see. It took a bit of time, but it's all coming to fruition. Soon you will all be able to see what we've been working on for the last three months. 

### Yield Farm Tips  [[20:07]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=1207)

**Mark:** Another thing, if anyone is not familiar with BarnBridge and how Yield farming and the DAO works– If you have a metamask wallet, you don't need BOND to check out how the DAO looks and works. 

It's a lot like how it will look if you want to get familiar with Governance and how everything works. Then you can launch the [BarnBridge](https://barnbridge.com) app on the website and learn that way. 

We did launch the BarnBridge app around a week early so that people could familiarize themselves with it. I don't know if we are going to do that with XYZ. Because people are already familiar, and it's already out. 

My advice is if you haven't checked out BarnBridge and you would like to get ahead of the game and learn about it. The best place would be the BarnBridge DAO. Also, one bit of advice for Yield farming. For people who may want to know. The way the BarnBridge claiming works via an individual basis, per pool. If you farm seven tokens for XYZ– if you are in the Aave pool, you will have to claim from there and the BOND pool. I'm just throwing that out there. So people are aware. You will have to claim via each pool you stake. 

**Tyler:** For gas fees, you may be better off apeing into one pool. That's another play on the game theory that ties into the Dr. Opium thing. There will be tax consequences for selling. There are other places you can stake tokens like Sushi– where you make an interest rate. So, you will be battling against that. And if you have low amounts, you may not want to drop $10 into seven pools because the gas costs will be higher than your claim. 

So, for smaller stacks, you should put it all into one pool and stick with that. We will release docs for that. Some of that stuff is not on the BarnBridge app because pools have ended. There is also only so much advice we can give. We are launching the token. I don't want to advertise how to game it. We can't talk about tricky things. Stuff that would make my lawyer's head explode– if we talk about it. Not this, more so the questions that might come in Discord. So, just know, we are going to release documents. And you will know the parameters. We'll be super clear about it– the same way as we are with other projects.

We believe in transparency. But, ultimately, it's up to you, the user, to figure out your plan of attack. The core team will not be helping the community or individual members figure out a game theory strategy for Yield farming. I don't even think we should talk about it. And on top of that, it would be a pain in the ass, and we don't have time. But the big part– I don't think we should talk about too much other than the documents. We'll tell everyone how it works, but it's up to you to figure out your plan of attack. 

**Mark:** I think that wraps up the majority of what we had for the day. 

### NFTs are almost ready for minting  [[24:39]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=1479)

**Mark:** One thing I would like to mention about the NFTs. I know I'm saying they are very close to being done. But, they will not be launching right away with the website. I want that to be clear. We are trying our best to get them launched as fast as possible.

**Tyler:** There will be things that launch quickly. Tim has a ton of artists that have been looking to launch on the platform. 

Our whole platform with auctions and minting won't get launched with the DAO. We will be all hands on deck. A lot of the front-end is coming together and getting done. But there is still a ton of work to do there. I want to set people's expectations. That's not launching in May. At a minimum, I know the auction and minting does not launch in May. 

There are two different types of auctions that happen on Universe. There are the core drops, where the DAO incentivizes people to make cool things. It could be artists. Or us creating code that shows bonding curves. We are working on one project that we are hush-hush about with the Limechain team. It has software and code involved that does something with the NFTs. Which I'm 100% sure no one has done before.

The creative stuff with these things– the imagery, music, anything from a core drop gets released creative commons. And the software is open-sourced. That's for core drops, xyzDAO core drops. 

When others come on the platform, wonderful artists or someone with a creative idea. Maybe, you are a part of pleaser DAO and are trying to push towards building long-term relationships with the communities. (that's more when the social aspects come out)

Tim is doing the genesis grant stuff and is working with Paris Hilton. I know that 3LAU has a lot of projects that want to start working with us. Dillon Francis has been asking me. On the other side of the equation of those core contributors. I don't think the community knows who they all are. Kevin Rose of True Ventures who started Digg. One of the guys from the Diem foundation. They hit me up regularly, "I have this massive media corporation that wants to talk to you." so massive media groups are not going to be giving their IP to the DAO. So, for artists that come on, it's off-chain intellectual property. 

I'll use Disney because I have not talked to them. So, that's an easy one. If Disney mints and puts a Mickey Mouse thing on our platform and their code and the characters– that will not be open-source. And they won't likely release the IP on our platform. Because that is their off-chain responsibility, and they deal with that. It's not something we should be handling as a decentralized organization. We don't have the teeth to go after. So, that's their job, role and responsibility. 

The same goes for the artists. If you mint something on the platform and there is a dispute over it. That's an off-chain dispute. We don't have those on-chain mechanisms to fight that battle for you. The easiest way to think about this– when the core drops launch, it's when they are ready, and we are building a ton of other stuff. There is code that goes into the characters and the comics. And even this Limechain thing, that I don't want to put too many details out about it. It could even launch before it.  

It's very separate from the ability to come in and launch auctions on the platform. It will be on a person-by-person basis. Where us as the DAO setup parameters. That will be one of the first things to go into Governance– aside from some of the Yield farming things. 

I'll tell you in advance people will want to come on.  They will want to launch on this platform. However, I think there will be a gap between when the auction and minting launch and when the DAO launches. We'll have a little bit of time to create those parameters with the community. We will have already started distributing tokens into the ecosystem. Not only are there people in the community who want to do drops with us. But there are external people and big fish that want to do stuff with us. 

I would just say, get ready. It's going to be fun. But it's not something I think we need to figure out on this call. And as far as the timing for the characters we are designing. It's TBD because there is a lot of stuff we are launching simultaneously. So, I don't want to commit to that for a lot of reasons. 

**Mark:** Yeah, we also don't want to leak the info about our other NFT projects that you guys don't know about yet. 😏

## Community Questions  [[31:14]](https://youtu.be/pYz3H-tWTOE?t=1874)

**Mark:** Alright, I think that's all we have for the day. We can go ahead and answer the questions you guys have in the project calls. 

**Question:** 
WEN DOCS?!
- WEN DOCS?!
- WEN DOCS?!
- WEN DOCS?!
- WEN DOCS?!
- WEN DOCS?!

It looks like you all are asking a bunch. But, we already answered this. 

**Question** 
Are we thinking about any L2 solutions for NFU? 
-Resistance- 

**Answer** 
Yes, we are. But, it's making things a little bit complicated. We have looked at Matic, we're thinking about dfinity, but the timeline to connect those things to our contracts is a bit hazy. 

Troy, I don't know if you want to talk a little about that? I know you have more. 

**Troy:** So, Tim brought up a good idea. If you can mint and almost spam people for a dollar on layer 2– with NFTs. How do we display those? And how we categorize them is a big issue. 

It seems there will be abuses of layer 2's– for NFTs– the same way there are abuses of cheap email. Everyone will kind of get spammed. It's something the community should be aware of and thinking about. 

We don't have a final solution for that. Right now, the mainnet is a barrier of entry, and that's a somewhat good thing. I'll leave it at that. 

**Tyler:** Especially when you get expensive NFTs. For example, you are 3BLAU where you sold 12 million or the Beeple that someone bought for 70 million. You want that on the main chain Ethereum. That's 100000% where you want to put that. So, I think there will be variability in the purpose and point. But Troy and Tim are right. Minting an NFT on an L2 does devalue an NFT. I think that for gaming purposes, there will be functions for everything. 

We are not there with NFTs yet, but that will come. So, we need to be able to have it on the mainnet. But, we are talking and working with a few L2 solutions about NFTs. We are talking with the Immutable team, which I believe uses zk's. We are talking with Polygon. We are looking very deep into dfinity– their CTO is a contributor and helped seed the project. That's a side chain, and so is Polygon. When Optimism comes out, we will look at it. Uniswap v3 just launched, and they have NFT capabilities, and they are in bed with Optimism. 

As we build the basis of this, we have to look at those other solutions. But, we have not made solidified decisions for that. The NFT landscape and the L2 landscape are evolving simultaneously at the same time– at break-neck speed. I think that it's wise for us as we are building to watch, but we need to construct the mainnet Ethereum first. 

**Mark:** Well said. I agree 100%. 

So, to move on from that question. 

**Question:** Will Yield farming be similar to BarnBridge? Will it be USDC - XYZ? Will it be once per epoch?

**Answer** 

**Tyler:** The answer to the first question is yes. 

**Mark:** I know there was some conversation about us doing epochs or continuous. Are we still going with the epochs?

**Tyler:** That's a Dragos question. But, I think the answer is yes. 

**Dragos:** Yes. 👍

**Tyler:** Milad thinks we need to wait a week. The epoch is partially to help with chaos. If it's continuous, in the beginning, it's chaotic. But, also, at large, you need skin in the game to get something. Nothing is free. Or we are giving away the token. And then it's worthless. So part of the mechanism of the timed epochs is not a timed dump that everyone complained about with BarnBridge. It's partially about putting skin in the game to get it, and you have to work for it. 

That's the thought process behind it. It's up to Dragos and Milad whether they do it continuously or with epochs.   

**Dragos:** With the skin in the game topic, the earlier to stake in the epoch, the more reward you will get towards the end. 

If you stake -> un-stake -> stake again. Then you will not get the same reward because you have un-staked in the middle of the epoch. 

That's the idea, skin in the game, bigger rewards. 

**Tyler:** Yup! Nice. 

**Question**
**Mark:** It looks like there is one more question. I've been getting it more and more. So, I think it will be good to address it. So people stop asking. There have been a ton of alt-punk projects. We've seen people doing Picasso everything. Sometimes a project will drop, and it'll be a Picasso or an alt of another of these projects. 

**Answer**
We've had some people reaching out about doing 3D NFTs and all of this other stuff. We won't permit anything to do with that. We do not have the permissions to give anybody. The answer is– no. we are not affiliated. And we are not doing that. We don't have the right to tell you what's okay.  

**Tyler:** You cannot mint NFPs on the platform. If the community allows it when it's decentralized, then I can't stop it. But I went through a lawsuit over that. When Matt Furie wants to launch pepes on the platform, that's fine. If people want to do artistic renditions of pepe, then do not name it pepe. It's really up to you all. If someone draws an oil painting of a frog– then it's up to you to deal with it. 

That's kind of what we were talking about earlier. At scale, the two best people on our team helping shape this is Tim and Troy. There is going to be a gap where we launch the DAO and the Yield farming first. Then the auction and minting stuff comes later. We'll likely have some things lined up in the meantime. But how we figure out the governance components are TBD.

I think it will start a little gated, where there are 'approved' drops and core drops. There will be a quality point. Ideally long term, the community governance gets to the point where anyone can come in like Rarible, and it's not as difficult as dropping something on SuperRare. We'll need some aspects of quality control for the front end, in case of child pornography or nazi paraphernalia. So the ability for the community to come in and launch NFTs will get established before we launch. Tim, in particular, is concerned if anyone can come to do whatever on the platform.

That's why Rarible sucks. Sorry if someone in our community works for the Rarible team. They are a good team. I think they are improving it. They launched ahead of everybody else, and they're fixing stuff about their platform. But that's why eBay sucks– you don't know what's real– it's chaos. So, we don't have that figured out. But we will, and we'll work with the community on it. Let's leave it at that. 

**Mark:** Nice. Okay, well, I think we can wrap this up. I think that's everything from questions in the Discord. 

Does anyone else have anything to mention or add?

**Tyler:** Milad's here now! So, what's up?

**Mark:** Yeah, Milad, want to say what's up to the XYZ team?

**Milad:** 👋👋👋👋

**Troy:** Serious alpha leaks are happening in that kitchen right now. 

**Dragos:** No, nothing is getting talked about... 

There you go, that's all you'll get to see. 


**Mark:** Thanks for tuning in and listening to us! We'll see you guys in two weeks for our next project call. And hopefully, by then, there will be a ton more goodies for you guys to check out. ✌️

**Everyone:** ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
