## Intro

**Mark:** Welcome to AMA #16. üëã

I will pass it on to Chuba, who will give some marketplace updates over the last week.

## Marketplace Updates üñº [[00:12]](https://youtu.be/hctWUAjQX1E?t=12)

**Ryan:** We are finishing up Sprint 6 and what happened in this sprint. The database migration has been completed. The new database is healthy and stable on the development environment. This unblocks a bunch of development work that has been an issue and have been resolving for the last few weeks. Now I can say that we have tested and stabilized the nextJS environment within the marketplace. It means we will see the SEO and the social media sharing very soon. Search filter by traits will also be done in this next update. So we're continuing with the back-end support in the next sprint. So that's done on the database side; we also need the front-end support. 

The nextJS integration has been added to the auctions, but the auctions have not been released yet. So when those are released, you will see the same things with the marketplace. As well as unblocking and continuing work on the 1155 support and the automated testing framework.

In the next sprint, on top of onboarding new DevOps and working to unlock these releases, there are a bunch of stability and scalability improvements that we're working on. These include reconfiguring the microservices with support for this new database, finishing up the filter by trade support and converting that to a more micro service architecture which will speed it up significantly. Also, beginning the back end for the auctions and connecting that with the new database. Additionally, we'll start testing the ERC 1155 support over the next two weeks and improve the user profile on my NFT's pages. I don't know how many improvements there are, but a lot of visual improvements will give you a clean experience when using the My Profile Page and be able to see your NFTs and interact with them and the marketplace. We did start discussing bundles and are making progress there. On top of bundles, we are beginning to plan for additional auction support outside of the auction house but in the realm of English and Dutch auctions.

I can pass it over to Zach to start talking about the Polymorphs. ü¶π

## Polymorphs ü§° [[02:47]](https://youtu.be/hctWUAjQX1E?t=167)

**Zach:** So last week, I said we would have burn to mint out on Thursday, which is tomorrow. We will push it back until Monday to do some final testing and sanity checks to ensure everything is functioning correctly. We have been testing a ton for the past few weeks, but I want to give the team another couple of days to test everything and ensure we're all good. I apologize for the delay on that. So Monday, burn to mint will go live. Shortly after that, we have a little gift for all the people that burn their Polymorph V1s to claim, and you will find out about that soon. Excited to release this new Polymorph front end. It looks really good. We have a Polymorphic Therapy episode premiering at 430 EST today.

**Mark:** That will be premiering on our YouTube, and we will put links in the discord for everybody. ü§ù

**Nick:** When we do give dates, we don't like pushing them back. That is our bad on that end. It works better for us because we have the week to resolve questions that the community may have and better for the community like us as Polymorph holders. As Zach said, we will have that gift coming for people who burn, but if you want to get that gift, you will need to burn your Polymorphs. 

**Mark:** We can open this up to the AMA section.

## Community Questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è [[05:16]](https://youtu.be/hctWUAjQX1E?t=316)

### **Question:** ‚ùì

If I bridge my Polymorphs to Polygon, can I use the bridge to get my Polymorphs back on Mainnet when I'm done with scrambling?

### **Answer:**

**Zach:** The answer is yes; the bridge works both ways. ü§ù

Go ahead, Chuba.

**Ryan:** I was going to clarify the response he got from **avgmayosandwich** regarding it being Polymorphs stay on L1 but scramble on L2's. They need to be bridged over if you want to scramble them on L2, so you can't hold them on L1 and run the scramble itself on L2; you have to bridge it over. 

**Nick:** The scramble will not work even on L1 for the old Polymorphs. If you want to scramble, you will have to burn them regardless of whether its on L1 or L2. That's the reason we pause scrambling and why we are upgrading the Polymorphs. 

**Tyler:** This may have been discussed before, but do people know how much it will cost per Polymorph to bridge them. 

**Ryan:** It's going to depend on gas prices. I don't have the estimate in front of me. I know it's cheaper if you burn more of them together, but not significantly cheaper. It should be similar across the board for everyone. I remember it being around .04 ETH at around 50 GWAY. So I will need to double-check and put a Tweet out for the community.

**Nick:** We can also drop that in the discord for everyone. I do want to say because Tyler said bridge when you are burning your Polymorph, they're not being bridged. We are set to have the Polymorph bridge live in a month.

**Zach:** Yes, that's correct.

**Nick:** We don't like giving exact dates because dates get pushed back or pushed forward depending on how things go. The bridge will be for Polygon. You will be able to scramble on Polygon for cheaper gas prices. Also, eventually, you will have the battle game, and that will be on Polygon. You must have your Polymorphs on Polygon to participate in the battle game. 

**Zach:** There will be a range of cheap to more expensive lobbies you can join. That's the main purpose of having the bridge.

The bridge will come out in three weeks to a month from burn to mint going live; hopefully, soon after that, we'll have the battle game out because that's the bridge's main purpose, to participate in the battle game on Polygon.

**Nick:** If you want to open it up for questions in the PreAMA channel, raise your hand. Mark usually leads to questions.

**Mark:** That was one of the first questions on the AMA channel. We don't have any questions on the forum.

**Ryan:** I double-checked and can confirm that I was about a magnitude off. It's about .002 ETH at around 50 GWAY to burn 1 Polymorph. So about $5 to $6 a Polymorph to burn and upgrade them from L1 to L2.

**Mark:** Significantly cheaper than what you were saying.

**Zach:** I was going to say when you said .04, but you're the Dev. 

**Ryan:** I was a magnitude off there. 

**Zach:** We should get the gas estimates for the actual bridge once it gets closer, and it should be fairly optimized.

### **Question:** ‚ùì

Is there any roadmap or action planned after submitting the Lummis bill in the US senate? How exactly will Universe tackle the upcoming relationships with the authorities?

### **Answer:**

**Nick:** The Lobby Lobsters was our effort at Lobbying towards crypto, and we've already donated all that money to that organization; I can't remember the name. From what I understood, it was a few years of runway for them. 

**Tyler:** Ongoing secondary fees would need to be looked at on an ongoing basis. People realize that this is buying art as a donation. The money was sent on-chain to Coin Center, who confirmed that it bought them years of runway. They've continued to work on lobbying efforts, including what has helped this recent bill. They were able to expand talent and world-class lawyers and worked with more politicians. That long-term will help the rest of the NFT industry for a long time to come. 

**Mark:** I don't think that is necessarily what this question is talking about.

**Nick:** They didn't ask about the Lobby Lobsters. They asked about what we were doing to help.

**Mark:** I don't think that's what this person is asking or saying.

The Lummis Bill is that drafted proposal released a few nights ago. He's trying to ask because there was much information about DAOs, unincorporated DAOs, and DAOs having to incorporate if they're in the United States. He's asking, Do we have an action plan?

**Tyler:** The answer to that is that we're aware of it. None of that is a law, and none of it is signed into law. The bill is going to be drastically changed between now and then. There will be good and bad things added and good and bad things removed. It's a draft of a bill. We will know more when it's signed into law as it gets closer and as an industry. To game plan exactly how this bill would affect us if it were signed into law today is a waste of everybody's time; it isn't the fact of what's happened. There's a bill proposal on the Senate floor, and lawyers will argue about it for the next couple of months, and we don't even know if it will be a law. We could spin our wheels on every proposal on the Senate floor.

Right now, we're operating on incomplete information, and it's a waste of our time to focus on it.

**Nick:** We recommend you follow Coin Center. They are doing good things that are helping the crypto community. We think they'll be helping on the Lummis bill that's being talked about.

**Tyler:** Someone said: Wyoming has DAO law currently.

You're right. But it's not federal law. How does this affect people internationally, and how does it affect people in the United States. It's all different. There may be tax benefits to structuring things in specific ways. As a community, we must deal with that as it comes out. We don't know immediately if this changes; we must wait. We've known that some degree of a bill like this would come into place so that crypto can be less of the wild wild west. There are various high-level things that we can make assumptions that will get included from us following the industry for so long. The situation here is that this thing is not a US law. 

We're paying attention to it, and it doesn't affect us right now. That's the true answer.

**Mark:** The follow-up question that **0x3t2‚àÜ** has: 

### **Question:** ‚ùì

And the Lobby Lobsters are helping to "bend this into cryptos benefit" ... plainly said.

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think there was confusion. Nick bought up the Lobby Lobsters. He was talking about how our money is being applied to this. Nick was saying that runway we provided for Coin Center was a few years of runway. Tyler mentioned they could hire better lawyers and put efforts towards these bills to make these revisions. People in the industry know what they are talking about and can review things like this versus senators who are writing a bill. 

**Ryan:** Everyone sees Lobby Lobsters, and we donated a bunch of money to Coin Center, and now they have the additional runway to do what they need to do. This is a really big law that everyone is paying attention to, but they also catch a lot of small things that nobody would notice without them being the ones to look at. I know I appreciate their efforts, and everyone else at Universe does as well.

**Tyler:** The rest of the stuff is also just assumptive from **Mr. V.** We're not going to do something where everyone on this call has to move to a completely different place in the world. It's unrealistic.

Also **Chad**, I agree that I also like state law, but it doesn't matter to federal law overseas. The federal government needs to get their answers straight on this. Then as an industry, we plan.

**Mark:** Some of us have already moved, so we don't want to move again.

**Tyler:** The bill seems promising that the government doesn't want to shut down crypto. We have to let the dust settle.

**Nick:** I don't think we have any new questions, and we've been trying to keep these short. I think we can call it early here. I want to say again that nobody in here or any discord will be messaging you good things. I advise you to turn off Discord DMs entirely; be aware, smart, and safe. Nobody's giving you free money, and nobody's giving you free ghost mints; it's just not happening.

**Mark:** Most importantly, don't miss the Polymorphic Therapy episode 2 premiere on our YouTube today at 04:30 p.m. EST. This is my favourite one so far. It's hilarious.

**Nick:** Like and subscribe if you are watching on YouTube afterwards.

**Mark:** Thank you for the questions. We appreciate it. **0x3t2‚àÜ** I appreciate it because the Lummis bill is something we're all paying attention to and trying to figure out. We will do whatever we need to do to move Universe forward. As Tyler said, we want to protect everyone on these calls, so we'll let the dust settle.

**Mark:** Thank you, everyone. ü´°

**Tyler:** Bye, guys. ‚úåÔ∏èüíô
