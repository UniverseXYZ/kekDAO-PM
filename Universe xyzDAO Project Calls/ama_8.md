## Intro

**Mark:** First things first. We just hit quorum on our vote. Universe Marketplace just got born, and it's about to start walking in a few days. 

I don't want to speak on behalf of the whole team. I'm 99% sure that after testing everything today, it looks like we will be good to go ASAP. We need to check boxes off on a few more things, but there has been no bad news yet, and it's looking like the end goal is on the horizon. We're almost there, and I think we're pretty proud of what we've got so far. But today, we're not going to give any direct updates, but we'll just open it up to the community for questions. We've been doing this the last few weeks because we're not building anything new. We're just finishing off the final touches on these contracts and integrations and connections, making sure everything is tip-top and making sure nothing's going to break, and everything's working how it needs to. 

Unless Ryan, Tyler or anybody wants to say anything, we can jump right into questions. 👇

## Pre AMA Question [[01:50]](https://youtu.be/WeVpd3zVAnY?t=110) ❓


### **Question:**

Viable marketing plans and strategies to reach new users?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** We talk about that every single day.

**Mark:** We have a ton of marketing content. We have videos. People who saw the video got teased, and we took it down because it wasn't the final version. We'll get that up tonight or tomorrow for everyone to see in the final edit. Some people got a sneak peek of the Marketplace on Twitter. 

### **Question:**

Are there any specific people on the team on this task? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** The answer to that is that the whole team helped with the marketing and the content that goes into marketing. 

Many of us have access to that Twitter, whether it's ideas, creation, or doing the actual posting. It's all a group effort. Part of being a DAO is leaning on each other sometimes and bringing it all together in harmony. Zach does a lot of cool designs. Dima does a lot of cool designs, but we have a ton of other artists that are also helping with a ton of marketing materials. The list goes on and on about how many people are helping with a lot of the marketing. But we do have people planning outpost and marketing strategies. Sometimes we make mistakes and post the wrong thing.

### **Question:**

Which time zone? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'm not sure what he's asking, but when we're talking, we usually say EST.

It's the easiest for us unless we don't directly specify. You can just assume we're talking about EST. 

I'm reading this next question, but I don't know if it's a question.

**Ryan:** The one about the Polygon spam?

**Mark:** No.

### **Question:**

Is there a way to incentivize voting?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** Yeah, I thought about that before.

**Mark:** That's honestly a good question.

**Algy:** You vote to stake in the DAO, and you earn DAO rewards for having your tokens.

**Mark:** The question is, do the people who don't vote still get the rewards?

**Tyler:** The problem is the cost of voting. 

One of the things we're doing on Barnbridge is moving to Optimism specifically because of network costs. I don't think it's good to incentivize voting because people can vote if something is very important to them. But if you only have $1,000 worth of XYZ stakes on the DAO, you're probably not going to vote on every proposal because when gas prices are high, it can be $150 to vote.

> I don't force people to vote.

**Algy:** If you have your token stake, you might not be voting every time. You're at least willing to, and we're a DAO. 

It's your choice to vote or not. The incentive is that you can earn more voting power by being staked in the DAO and ready to vote if you feel like you want to.

**Mark:** Yeah, that's a good question, though.

**Algy:** Okay. Send a message in the chat if any of you guys get muted. Justin brought up that if anyone's muted and has a question and we muted you by mistake, send a message in the Pre AMA chat, and we will unmute, and you can ask your question.

### **Question:**

These next four questions are about the Marketplace. 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'm not going to say any day, just so the Devs don't come out here and murder me. It's coming in the next 3 to 6 days, hopefully. I'm not going to be able to give an exact date. What's the best feature request suggested by the community? That's on the short-term road map? I think that would be on-chain orders, am I right, Chuba?

**Ryan:** 100% does open up a few cool things: DAOs can trust us to trade the NFTs that they own. Real long chains and multi-stakes can participate in Marketplaces, which they can't.

**Mark:** Currently, on Universe— with our minting contracts, you can create your collections and mint your artwork to that contract. That is the closest thing you can have to a digital signature, and many artists did request that. [Manifold](https://twitter.com/manifoldxyz), from what I understand, you own your own Minting Contracts; we followed their footsteps. We were planning to do it, but honestly, I think that many people wanted those features. 

We're going to continue to work on integrations. We are having conversations about the best way to silo new community features. We don't think everything needs to go to a DAO vote, but major things do. 🗳

### **Question: Resistance**

Will Universe support Polygon as well? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're not going to be integrated with any L2s from the get go. 

Our mindset is to start on Ethereum, and we will build and bridge all the L2s. We've said this before; we think the NFT ecosystem needs to be a cross-chain. All of crypto is trending towards cross-chain, but it's easiest for us to start on Ethereum. And also truly believe that most NFT assets probably should be minted on Ethereum. There are certain special use cases that I can agree with that probably shouldn't be. When you mint on Ethereum, you can move it to Polygon, bridge it back, and then move it to Optimism, depending on what type of thing you want to do with your NFT. Or maybe it's a gaming NFT, and you want to have it on Polygon, but then one day, someone allows you to loan that out on Optimism, so you want to be able to bridge it back.

Not that some of these L2 NFTs have and can't do that. It's just the way that we thought was the right way to build and how we want to build, too. Suppose people are building NFT projects on all these L2s. I don't see why we wouldn't want to do that and help because one thing that I've learned about 
Polygon is, and I didn't think about this because I lived in America, but most people in other countries are using L2s to mint their work because of how cheap it is. 

I've started using a lot of the L2s. Tyler talked to me about them moving Barnbridge to Optimmism. You mentioned it on this call, but we want to integrate with L2s like [Optimism](https://twitter.com/optimismPBC), [Polygon](https://twitter.com/0xPolygon), [Metis](https://twitter.com/MetisDAO), and even some ZK things like [Immutable X](https://twitter.com/Immutable) because games have so many assets. Not everything needs to be on Ethereum. But I think it's a good place to start for a lot of this. 

### **Question:**

What and who is [Particlon](https://twitter.com/Particlon_xyz)? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Particlon is the [Charged Particles NFT](https://twitter.com/DefiNft). I think [Ben Lakoff](https://twitter.com/benlakoff) might be in here. I saw him typing. Ben, do you want to come up and answer this question about what is Particlon.

**Algy:** Even if he doesn't want to or is busy. I can answer it.

**Mark:** I mean, Al, if you want to take it away? 

### Technical Difficulties ⚠️

**Mark:** We're having technical difficulties; we want to bring Ben up here so he can explain this because he's one of the geniuses behind this all. And also, we don't want to butcher it, but I believe in Aly.

**Algy:** I was only introduced to it through that event we went to. It was in Denver. It was a Charged Particles event; we ended up sponsoring it at Universe. 

Mark did a couple of panels there and did a really good job talking at those panels and explaining to people what was going on. Tim and Chuba also spoke on one of the panels. They had this blimp that flew around and would drop things. One of the things was an airdrop POAP and many different things. One of the things was a QR code— you could scan and mint passes— there were only 25 —that get you presale access to Particlons. That's going to be a generative profile picture. It's a drop that Charged Particles is releasing, and it'll include, I'm sure, a lot of the tech from Charged Particles and some of the new stuff they're doing. 

Let me see if I can get Ben talking about Particlons.

**Ben:** I didn't want to cut you off. Can you hear me? 

**Mark:** Here we go.

**Algy:** I'm really excited for Particlons!

**Ben:** Hey, yeah, you crushed it. Also, you said a kind of cool event? I mean, Tim opened for Tyco DJing. 🤙

You had all your guys on stage. It was super cool. 😎

Now, I don't want to talk too much about it. I shared a link. Friends of Universe and everything you guys are doing here, this is your show. Particlon Charge Particles first Generative Drop. It's got all of our tech capabilities right off the bat. And we're whitelisting a bunch of Polymorphs because we love those little things. I shared the Twitter there, and I don't want to steal your guy's stage. This is a Universe AMA.

**Mark:** We like to bring people on so they can talk about their NFTs because we're an NFT Marketplace. It gets people learning about things, and we're big believers in education in the space. We think the stuff you guys are doing is breaking boundaries for NFT. DeFi NFTs are cool, and I don't think enough people learn about them.

**Ben:** Charged Particles is an NFT protocol first. NFTs are not just art, but what we enable is an NFT to hold other assets. We give it its own smart wallet, and then that smart wallet that NFT controls can own other tokens, whether they be fungible or non. This has tremendous gaming attributes. We've segmented it into different guilds. We have a gaming guild. There are a bunch of cool projects and a music guild. Somebody just closed their pre-seed with [Unchained Music](https://twitter.com/UnchainedDistro). But gaming has always been this cool vertical. 

So, Particlon allows us to flex those capabilities. We have partnerships with Mona and a bunch of other ones we're talking about. We'll have a full 3D render. Aesthetically, these will be freaking sweet, but they'll also come preloaded with many goodies. So your NFT is not only generatively randomized based on traits, etc., like normal. It's pioneering the way of this nonfungible token loaded full of fungible tokens and another level of randomness. It mints later this month, the 29th public on the 30th. We'll be doing a bunch of whitelists and stuff for Polymorph people because we love you guys.

**Mark:** We love you, bro. 💙

One of the coolest things that I think Charge Particles has, I don't know if they completely built it by themselves or maybe they had a hand with it. They built these NFTs that basically can be vesting contracts. I thought that was a cool use case for NFT to be able to hold crypto tokens and then release them at a rate or every week. I think that's another cool use case that I don't think people are diving into on the NFT side.

**Ben:** Definitely, and I'll share a link on that. We call them vesting capsules. Great use case. Anybody that's raising capital and wants to put their investor tokens in an NFT, I would be happy to chat for sure.

**Mark:** Thanks for coming up, Ben. We appreciate you, man. That party was sick. 🔥

### Shoutout: Mango

**Mark:** Shout out to Mango because he killed that thing. He put all that together.

**Ben:** He was finally back. I think he damn near killed himself doing it.

**Mark:** It was awesome. 

Let's jump to the next question. We've answered this question Synthaman; about XYZ holders getting fees and when. 

We are not doing that right now. But that's something that we can bring to a forum chat and a DAO vote as a community. But that's not our plan at the moment. 

I skipped over the Polygon vs Optimism debate, but I loved reading it.

**Ryan:** Yeah, I will chime into that if I may.

**Mark:** Yeah, Chuba, please.

**Ryan:** There is much spam on L2s, side chains, and other alternative L1s. The way forward is that anything on side chains that display publicly should just be whitelisted by the NFT owner— on the Marketplace. Otherwise, it just won't be displayed. That way, you can get all the upside of these NFTs without worrying about spam because it will be entirely up to you what you display. 

So yeah, I agree spam sucks.

But I don't think we're going to have to live with it forever, especially not on Universe.

**Mark:** Nice. That's something to look forward to, right? A spamless world.

**Ryan:** Yeah.

### **Question:** 

Are there any unique features you guys are the most excited about for people to try out? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I guess we could all answer this. 

My favourite is the Auction House. When Justin 3Lau did his Auction, I thought it was a cool style. I thought this could be a creative, useful tool. But the fact that we put a 0% fee on top of it and you can sell anything, I think it's going to spark more. I don't want to say it's going to fire up the NFT market, but imagine if we could go out here and test, you can personally go and market your own Auction, and you get your own personal auction link. We're letting you create a landing page on the interface that allows you to create a personal auction page. 

You have your link, and you can send it to people, and you can promote it. I want to sell my Gold Bored Ape or sell this one-of-one (1/1) piece of art that I've been working on. I think it's something that doesn't exist right now in the NFT Marketplace— an Artist or a Collector can properly test the market of their work.

We understand that a 0% fee is crazy when some people think about it. We're doing it because, first off, we just wanted to build an Auction House where Artists could go and test how much their work is worth. We didn't think that testing a market— we didn't think that we needed to take a fee for that. But we, as a team, could justify taking a small fee on a secondary sale. We left it as is on the Auction. (0%) 

You can auction an NFT on the Auction House, but you have to take a risk to discover the value. Sometimes, it may not even sell for the floor price when auctioning something. I don't know if that happens in NFTs. I know it used to happen in sports card auctions when Algy and I used to be buying sports cards.

**Ryan:** You can set a reserve on the auctions to avoid the risk of selling it below what you're comfortable selling it for, which is nice.

**Mark:** Yeah. You have your reserves for sure.

**Ryan:** One of the features I'm excited about is the collection wide bidding

Two reasons;

1. Bids are on-chain 
2. NFT prices are determined by sellers
   - Most orders are the sell-side. 📉
   - I'm excited to see buyers take some power back. 📈

That'll be cool.

**Mark:** Algy, do you want to chime in?

What's your favourite feature that you're looking forward to on the Universe Marketplace?

**Algy:** I just went to this FLUF event in Austin. I was able to link with a ton of Artists and Performers. I was able to educate so many big-name people and their management about how NFTs will work on Universe. How it's going to work is you're going to be able to mint if you're an artist and don't have Dev talent. Our goal is to eventually set up for you to be able to mint on decentralized contracts that you own. You'll be able to mint your NFTs in whatever way you want. You'll be able to do that easily with even a large amount of art. These tools will take time, but eventually, we want Artists to have a way to mint any drop they want and sell it however they want on our site. And if you're a big Artist and you want to do your one-on-one, you don't even have to worry about auctioning when you auction it; you don't have to worry about fees because there we also tools for artists.

A good group has agreed that that will end up working well; we'll add these tools to the Universe, and then we'll leave them there for everyone to use. Specifically, I'm going to push for this regardless of what the team wants. I'll try to get proposals to have minting tools. I know the space well, and I know that Artists need this right now. There's no way for artists to do anything without a Dev. What are you going to do? Go release on OpenSea or pray that Nifty allows you to release your content. Even in that situation, you're on the centralized contracts, and then if you release through Rariable, you're paying fees on every NFT. So there needs to be some lazy minting process and more available options for artists to be able to release content. 

So many Artists have their best content, NFTs, that they are just saving because they don't want to release it and have to split the money because they don't know how to build a smart contract. That's not fair to an artist to expect them to have to hire a Dev team. Then they'll be able to sell these on our Auctions and get zero fees in that aspect. Then if I do want to do primary on a different way, I even want to do other ways that probably won't have zero fees. 

I would try to push for a proposal, and those types of things are things I want, and I think we are all aligned on that. We all want there to be tools for artists, and that's the whole point of Universe, from my understanding of the Founders, the reason they created it.

**Mark:** It's all about the artists. That was our approach. The collectors are important too, but I think we did have more so the artists and collectors in mind, and some people ask why we launched minting first. It aligned with our original plan that we wanted to build tools for artists, and minting contracts and custom minting contracts are what the artists were asking for. So we jumped on that.

**Zach:** I'm most excited for the decentralized part of the Marketplace and see how that rolls out. And then I'm also excited for Temple, which is something that you all see coming soon.

**Algy:** I can't believe that we talked about Temple. I'm immensely excited for Temple. Nick Warden has been working super hard on that. He's been doing a great job organizing that with the group that has been putting that together. Big shout out to our Sadema too. He's our graphic designer. He does an amazing job too.

**Mark:** Temple is coming, but we're not going to say too much about that because that's highly secret alpha, and we'll tell you about the name. 

**Tyler:** I agree with you, Zach. I add that one of the things I'm looking forward to is that there will be more transactions during the development process. We're going to be moving to 2 weeks sprints. So the updates we give, if we don't prioritize a feature request, I think will honestly help the community start to understand better a feature requested go. But it's a massive lift. This feature requested that we add sprint so we can all, as a company, prioritize and understand setbacks are in certain requests that will allow us to be a lot more active and transparent.

### **Question:**

James F's question is; What's the plan to make sure someone doesn't fork the Marketplace on other chains and beat Universe to demand there? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Honestly, the only thing they'll be able to fork is our contracts, and we will start building. We have partners.

**Ryan:** Our L2 and side-chain contracts are going to be different from our L1 contracts.

**Mark:** You can't deploy the same contracts on polygon as ETH.

**Ryan:** L2 specific, so they'll be built specifically for low transaction fees instead of our main net contracts built to be usable even when gas fees are high.

**Tyler:** In the back end, you'd have to send those APIs. I don't know. I'm sure we will get one side chain, but ultimately, I think we should probably look at polygon because,

**Mark:** We have been talking to polygon. I've been talking to polygon for the last six months about this. It's just that we're not done with ETH.

**Tyler:** Polymorphs have a polygon; Polymorphs League DAO has some Polymorphs. We've already been working with that team. We just have to get on; we need to get it working on Ethereum. Most value transfer NFT is on Ethereum, so that is the carrot. I think polygon and optimism are absolute that we should look into. I don't know if we need to build an NFT market for Solana.

**Mark:** I don't think we're going to do that.

**Tyler:** We are going to spread ourselves too thin we're not going to be all right.

**Mark:** We are talking about L2s. As long as its own whole other thing.

**Tyler:** The point is that someone probably there's a chance that takes Solana as an example. If someone builds a Marketplace there, they may be better at being a Solana market because of our focus on ASM machine. So I think that instead of trying to be all things focused on getting one thing right and prioritizing other L1s and L2s, that initial success. Over 90% of the volume has to be on.

**Ryan:** I don't think people trust moving things like Board Apes or Punks over the polygon. But when they do ZK's on there, people will be more likely to do that. I think we'll want to be on polygon at that point.

**Tyler:** It's probably not Board Apes there when you look at something like optimism. It's probably a more financial and NFT perspective, like DeFi and the uni B3, those G uni things like Olympic bonds. That's a very different type of Marketplace. But my gut says that there's an L2 rivaling the financial value of a base chain. It might not be hard.

**Mark:** It might be particles.

**Tyler:** It might be music. I think market development is over 90% of our effort or volume right now.

### **Question:**

We had another question; Are there plans for stables as a way to buy and sell NFTs? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Yes. You're also going to be able to use XYZ. I think it's DAI and USDC, but not Tether.

**Ryan:** Less stables XYZ. You can list NFTs for sale and make bids right from the get-go.

**Algy:** I want to point out the L2. We have stuff we want to incorporate on the Ethereum end of our Marketplace. That is more of a priority than building out something for an L2 until we have most of our features released. At that point, Vitalik comes out and tries to tell us every month that Ethereum is going to be low gas fees soon. We're going to have to see where the space is at naturally. Just let it flow and see what happens. Once we get to the point where we're ready to expand, by that point, Ethereum might be low gas fees. Everybody who has been building out all these L2 stuff has wasted their time because they could have waited for an Ethereum and built on Ethereum. We got to see where we are at in this space. That sounds like I'm big on ETH, and I am. I'm down to wait and see how long it takes for Ethereum to get it right.

**Mark:** We have a question. Is there any news on the Polymorphs? I don't think there's anything; jump out like crazy news. We've talked about the comedy writers we've been working with. We're going to try to make some animated polymorph episodes.

**Zach:** The Polymorphs are in therapy right now. The show until the Marketplace is up and running. The Polymorphs are just working out their problems and talking it through with some real expert-level guys. Well, you'll see what all that is about soon.

**Algy:** Hopefully.

### **Question:**

It looks like Gunner has a question about his beloved Polys and wants to know; If they're planning on destroying the Seekers? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I do not have any Alpha on that. The higher powers above me do, though.

**Ryan:** I'm not sure about the Seekers. The best psychiatrist I know tells me that Charles needs 30 days institutionalized.

**Algy:** Tyler is the one who leaked the alpha on Goblin Town in the FLUF. People speculate because Tyler loves the Polymorph. Does that mean they're connected? They just talked about in this AMA yesterday how Goblin Town works. Are there going to go and destroy the Seekers or something like that? I don't know exactly what they were saying. I probably said that wrong just now. They said it in the AMA. So we don't know what it's going to be. But that's the speculation that the people in the FLUF chatter community say that they think the Polymers will have. Don't do anything ridiculous based on what we just said. It's pure speculation that the Polymorphs are going to be a part of Goblin Town. 

**Zach:** I will just emphasize and just say that's FLUF's project.

Tyler gave it to FLUFs, and it's not much more than that. We don't know anything on the Universe side other than what Tyler thought. Even Tyler doesn't know what they're going to do with it.

**Mark:** The only thing we know is that we're all going there.

**Tyler:** Are they asking about Goblin Town?

**Mark:** We're going to Goblin Town.

**Zach:** They were more asking about the Seekers and how it was all related, and we were saying that,

**Tyler:** Dorian, as the Silo people are our boys, whatever they do. But I gave all creative direction to FLUF World and started working on deviants. The artist that I was using, I could find out running that project. The alpha that people are getting is mostly just disinformation. Aaron found a group in New Zealand that develops the game. They source a pretty sick artist. I've helped them, and Zach has helped them with the dynamics of the drop and what we're generally doing. But my gut says they're prioritizing Seekers, Goblin Town, and the stuff I'm doing with the deviants. I've shared with Aaron and the FLUF World guys, making sure all the art lines up because I want those to be compatible in the Metaverse that we built in the same way they're in the Polymorph are compatible working. We've been building together for years. I would assume that we're just going to build together and have fun. I think that ecosystem between Universe and Polymorph and what the Enter DAO squads like Sharded Mind, what FLUF World is doing, what ASM and what Seekers is doing, to me, are the most technically advanced things happening in all of NFTs right now.

I don't see us stopping building together because a lot of the innovation comes from us throwing ideas off each. We focused on getting the Marketplace out, and FLUF World and ASM can focus specifically on those things. But I think what's coming behind it is much non-shared work that we've been waiting to release. As we keep building, we will be more opportunities to collaborate.

**Algy:** Tyler. Do you want to tell us anything about the deviance at all?

**Tyler:** No, just that we're building a dgen race track.

**Algy:** We'll keep the dgens a secret.

Just a sneak peek or something. There's already been one. There's already been a sneak peek of the deviance, and you all had to be paying attention. You can go back and find it. I don't know if it's still there, but there's been a sneak peek, believe it or not. It was super obvious.

**Tyler:** One of them. But we haven't. We're launching them like 2D art with 3D backgrounds, but the 3D art comes directly behind it because of the 2D characters.

**Mark:** Plenty. Your question is good.

**Tyler:** I just don't want to leave too much, alpha.

**Mark:** Then don't; who knows?

**Algy:** I think we'll leave it at that.

**Mark:** We're focused on the Marketplace right now. How will the FLUFs and ASM, et cetera, prioritize XYZ over OpenSea and other Marketplaces? Well, I can just say that we're aligned with them directly, and we are going to have competitively lower fees. We can't force people to sell on a Marketplace, but our team at FLUF, all the Founders and everybody are very aligned with Universe, and they're going to be. We hope that they're going to be pushing us over OpenSea.

**Tyler:** Aaron was asking us, yeah, I think they're planning on integrating with us at a high level. The lowest hanging fruit would be to help them build a custom interface that lives on FLUF with their website. They can post a market and probably want to do that for your project.

**Mark:** We're all going to make it. Don't worry, everyone; we're almost there. I'm sorry that we've held all the Polymorph stuff from you guys. I think it's important that we've pushed out the Marketplace and prioritized everything potentially. I think we've gotten through most of the questions. If anybody has any final thoughts or anything they want to ask us, I'll give everyone a few more minutes. 

## Shoutout:

**Mark:** We want to shout out to the community, too. We've been building this for a long time. We appreciate many people who have stuck with us and told their friends about us. Our community has grown massively. I think there were only 2 or 3000. I don't even know how many people you had, but we've gained much following because of friends and people sticking with us. You can't do it without the community, and we want to say we appreciate it as builders that everyone was sticking with us while we've been building everything. 

### **Question:**

Why do orphans like, Boomerang so much? You guys are pretty savage.

**Tyler:** Okay. All right, dude.

### **Question:**

Can you talk about the XYZ token?

### **Answer:**

**Algy:** Marketplace's just too easy to be exploited, not even our own. We're never going to incentivize people to list or sell NFTs on our Marketplace because it is too easy to be exploited. It's that simple. There will be incentives for holding your polymorphs so that you can count on that. So I guess that's subliminal. I think a way to incentivize trading. Not really. We're just trying to make the Polymorphs fun. It's not about if they're trading at a rapid volume or anything. It's just about the current people. There are only 170 Polymorphs listed right now out of 10,000. That's ridiculous. It's because all the people who hold them want to keep them.

**Add Speaker:** What are we talking about?

**Algy:** Incentivize people for holding them? That's kind of it. We're just trying to build cool stuff for the Polymorphs. They're a character for you to use in the games we release. That's what they are.

**Mark:** I mean, we're believers in the open Metaverse. People are going to build stuff, and you're going to integrate with Polymorphs. We just finished a lot of our art for the World Wide Web thing. We're about to send over some stuff to those guys so they can integrate the Polymorphs into their game. Yeah, we're working on it plenty. We don't talk about the price. XYZ, you probably shouldn't sell your dog. Don't sell your dog, dude.

### **Question:**

I want us to address what Mica just asked, though. Mark, can you answer that question? Would we be able to contact a seller on Universe?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** If you guys know how silo works, we will try, and I was with the silo guys this weekend; they want to integrate with us. We think that that would be a cool tool to integrate with. We're going to try our best to try and get that thing on. They're on sends net; they're not even on Ethereum. They explained to me this weekend that it's possible. But we don't want to build a whole decentralized messaging app. But we do like the ability to contact sellers. This does open up an opportunity for scams. Being able to message someone on a Marketplace is just as dangerous as accepting a message on Discord from someone you don't know. We're going to have to teach the community; hey, let's not click on links from people you don't know. Don't give people your seed phrase that kind of stuff. I still think that education is something that we can't get too far ahead of because we will always have new people in the space. This weekend at south by a south plaza, I heard someone say that getting robbed or hacked is your baptism in the Crypto and NFTs.

I don't necessarily agree with that. I guess it does help you figure out, I got to be careful, but everyone shouldn't have to come into crypto space and learn how to do this and then get robbed and be sorry this happens to everyone. I think that's kind of shitty. That's how the industry is. So I believe that we need to focus on that.

**Algy:** That Discord could take is when you make an account, start the profile off with Discord messages on private. I do not understand why Discord accounts start as default where anyone can message you because that's the source of how many scams are happening. If most people just kept their messages private, it would prevent a lot. But even then, I remember having a Party Bears. You got to be so careful. Even when you're being careful, you got to be careful because it can happen when you would just like in the weirdest situation that makes no sense.

**Mark:** One thing. We are going to have those. You're going to be able to connect your Twitter to verify that the person is their actual Twitter. That may help to start. If you tune into many of our early project calls, we talk about turning Universe into a social Media Marketplace. I have already spoken a lot about how NFTs are so social in nature. That's why Facebook and Instagram have jumped on the NFTs. Facebook has rebranded to Meta. They're very bullish on the Metaverse, but they're already so social by nature. But one thing that I didn't understand is why do we have to leave the website to go to Discord or Twitter? Why can't we bring some of that to the website? There are a lot of Internet KPIs that marketers use. But one of the most important things is how long does someone stay on your website before they leave? I never understood why OpenSea just never let people message each other. I think it's because they don't want to deal with the headache of scams on their platform.

We're never going to get rid of scams in the world. Scammers will keep scamming, and they will find out new ways. It's like whack a mole; you kill one, and five more pop up. We can do our best to eliminate these things, and we'll try our best, but we're not going to not do it, though, like OpenSea and some of these other platforms. But our best bet is to probably integrate with silo on this because building decentralized messaging is not an easy lift. 

### **Question:**

Mica, this is pretty good too, bro; Pre-selected questions. 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think that works. But eventually, you're going to get to a point where you maybe aren't going to be able to communicate or perhaps you can take the conversation off. I don't know. We'll have to consider it. I think it's something to consider, but it will lead to many dead-end questions. I don't know if anyone listened to one of David's chats this weekend at FLUF World. They were streaming the events. They use bots for talking to people in some of those things, and even a messaging app; you'd be surprised sometimes when you're talking about a bot, and you don't even realize it or even one of those bots that's in support of the website that you go and view.

I mean, AI is getting very smart, and I don't know; there's much stuff we got to think about with the messaging part. That's part of why it's in the later renditions of the market.

That's the best way to answer that. We are trying to decentralize it all, but we got to go in steps. We got to get the Marketplace out, and then we'll work on it. That's where our heads are at is more of a social Marketplace where people can contact each other and make galleries and view each other's NFTs and then maybe comment on a gallery that someone hosts. We have a whole bunch of really cool ideas on how to bring information and data to the Marketplace and allow everyone to learn and get information so that they're not. How do we, this is another thing Tim has talked to me about, and I feel it's ingrained in it.

It's just that we do need to continue to educate people. What about the history of Board Apes. What about the history of some of these things. How do we get that information onto the Marketplace so that people can learn about NFTs? Because like we said, we have new people every week, every day. I think that we need to continue to try and educate those people, or we're not going to make it as an industry. We need to knock it complacent and think that we're better than anyone, and we need to be able to be when we were all like we're all going to make it GM. No man was left behind. I think that's really what many people liked about NFTs. And then we had a lot of scammers and influencers kind of ruined that because people got burned. I think the people that stick around are the people who want to help each other. So I just think we need more of that in the NFT space. But I'll end my ramble and let everyone go because I don't think we have any more questions.

But if anybody has any closing thoughts on the Universe team, for sure, chime in. But I think we've gone for an hour.

**Algy:** Later, once we've built out the Marketplace and have that ready, it's also an option. We're going to have a way for you to link people's social media. You can just talk to them through there, and we'll try to get that set up as fast as possible. I like silo.

**Mark:** Yeah, we like silo. We want Charged Particlons. We will continue to align with all the best builders in the space. You can bet on that. We will try to support every artist in the NFT space the best we can with custom contracts and anything we can do. So bring on the feature request, I guess. Open the floodgates. Get ready, Rayne. It's coming, brother. I love all the posts on the Universe Merch.

Thank you for joining. We love you all. Thank you, everybody, for being so supportive. We'll see you guys next week, and I think hopefully, we're going to have a Marketplace to play with by next week. This is what a peak NFT Marketplace looks like, and there's not a f---ing thing you can do about it, baby.
