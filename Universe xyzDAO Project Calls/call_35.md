## Intro

**Mark:** Welcome to Project Call #35 of Universe XYZ DAO. 👋 

I will hand it off to Ilia so he can share the most recent Marketplace updates.

## Marketplace Updates 🖼 [[00:17]](https://youtu.be/UjTJ0ALWXX8?t=17)

**Ilia:** You received the usual update in Discord, and we finalized Sprint 8 and were able to hit a lot of the set goals. 🏁 🏃💨

We still have work to do, and I'll do more in-depth info in a bit. At a high level, we managed to spin up 70% of the infrastructure and are aiming to finalize this in springtime. By infrastructure, I mean the dev environment we used to start testing everything built over the past few months. We will begin laying out the production environment and check how it performs, including the scalability and performance improvements. Looking at Sprint 8, we needed to reconfigure the microservices to support the new DB in the new infrastructure setup. It's almost done, and we haven't started it because we need it to be entirely done. So we'll do that in this Sprint. We were discussing the filter by trade microservices support, and that's done and ready for testing with the new environment.

ERC 1155 support is also ready, integrated and waiting to be tested. We made some improvements to the user profile page and the My NFT pages that are ready for testing and done. The nextJS introduction in the auctions front end, the components are almost there, and we started building the front end with the components, and that's done. We started working on this to support the bundles in the front end and aim to be ready for testing in Sprint 10. Stan is back and working on the automated tests, which I've mentioned quite a bit. He already did minting functionality and disrupting tests, and we are continuing with that on Sprint 9. One of our optimistic goals was to start English and Dutch auction development; we need to do more research on how it will work in general. So that's on pause, but I'll keep you updated in the next few Sprints.

We needed to do a little tweak for the tiered auction smart contracts. It's awaiting a code review, and that's about Sprint 8. For Sprint 9, it will be short in terms of description. We have the new environments up and have already started testing the back and front end with all the improvements. We will continue to work on the bundle support, the tiered auctions front end and back end, and that's for Sprint 9. 

**Mark:** Sorry I was muted. I appreciate all the updates.

We can pass it over to Zach for the Polymorph updates.

## Polymorph 🤡 [[04:56]](https://youtu.be/UjTJ0ALWXX8?t=296) 

**Zach:** Gm! 🌅

We still have burn to mint going on. Urge people to go and grab some V2 Polymorphs because I like them. I think people have been enjoying seeing their 3D versions. We've been working with Bianca and Lime Chain to prepare the Polymorphic bases. So we've been doing a bunch of smart contract testing, testing the front end, making sure that everything is sound there and then in the background. We're working on some gaming elements to come after the Polygon Bridge comes out. We got to get these Polymorphic faces out the Polygon Bridge, and then holders of Polymorphs will have some interactive gaming stuff to play around with. Bianca, do you have anything else to add?

**Bianca:** No, you said it pretty well. Thank you. 🤝

**Mark:** I want to reiterate what Zach mentions: you will get more games and access to things. If you burn the Polymorphs to the V2 contract, the V2s will be able to scramble and battle your Polymorphs and bridge them over to polygon and scramble them and play games over there. We will continue building more gaming types with more interactive games where you can control your Polymorphs and bring them to life, even with Unreal engine. 

**Zach:** We're building a zombie corn gun shooter game for the Polymorphs. You will need a V2 Polymorph. One thing I forgot to mention and want to reiterate is that we're doing this Polygon Bridge because we need it for the gaming aspect, and scrambling is really fun. With the price of ETH being pretty low and it's a lot more affordable now than it was. When we get the Polymorphs over to polygon, it'll be virtually gas-free scrambling. Then the Polymorphic faces are also built to scramble and create the type of face you want. We'll lower the point of entry for scrambling on those down from .01 to .001 for the single scramble and then .05 for the full scramble. So that's exciting for me because Polymorphic face will be able to go to the polygon as well, then it will be affordable to manipulate your NFTS. That's all for Polymorphs for now.

**Mark:** To reiterate, the faces claim will be free, and if you burn your Polymorph, you can claim that. We are leaving the Polymorph burnt to mint open until the DAO or the community decides they want to turn that off or not. No rush to burn, but, many fun and cool reasons to burn, and there will be more reasons to burn in the future.

**Zach:** There's no rush unless you want a low token ID for Polymorphic faces.

**Mark:** What Zach was saying about it's going to be cheaper to scramble on polygon, and that right now, it is pretty cheap to scramble your current Polymorphs on mainnet. A few nights ago, I was scrambling 20 to 30 GWAI and ended up scrambling a full set. I scrambled 4 or 5 times and only spent $100 in gas and $200 in ETH; now I have a full Tom Brady. I was excited the scrambling was back on because I had some Polymorphs that were closed. This might change or be interesting to some people. If you have a Polymorph that you were scrambling on mainnet previously and burn it, it does reset your scramble price. If you burn your Polymorph, you are restarting your scramble. So you have an easier chance to go maybe get a better one.

So when I noticed that the scramble price had reset, I was like, I'm going to do this one. So if you have any Polymorphs that are close, it might be good to go and revisit them and try to scramble them again.

**Tyler:** That's dope.

Scrambled full Clown Charles now. 🤡 🔀 

**Zach:** What? Full what? Naked? 

**Tyler:** No, like clown hat. I think I have maybe the most complete Clown Charles that's a virgin. So I guess I'm going to make it not a virgin. Let's scramble the whole thing.

**Zach:** I want to see more of the badges pop up. The full sets are tough, but getting that badge is fantastic. I was going to say that the cool thing about them being iframe NFTs is that the new content will typically render without having to refresh the token.

**Mark:** This is a little side comment, but did we talk to Nick and the Polymorph team about the full set trade?

**Zach:** I'm talking to Nick about changing some things. There's one more thing that we need to change. I did a Twitter poll asking if you have two lightsabers because there are two different types, a double and a single. If you have different lightsabers, is it still a Kimbo? And the community said yes. So we got to change some things.

**Mark:** I agree with the lightsabers, if you have a blue one and a red one or a blue single and a red double, you should still get the Kimbo, and that's not going to change the rarity score. We want to specify that we will change a few things on the badges, but it will not change anybody's rarity. It's only going to change how the current full trait or full set badges show up because currently, some of them you have to have two. 

**Zach:** We all like the badges, and getting two footballs, a football jersey, and a football helmet is tough. If we can make it, you only need one football, and you can have a beer; on the other hand, you still have the full set. You're good, at least on the badge. 

## Polymorphic Therapy 🧘 [[14:30]](https://youtu.be/UjTJ0ALWXX8?t=870)

**Zach:** I didn't say anything about Polymorphic therapy, but we have another episode finished up. We have had two drafts of it so far, but I wanted to make this one special for reasons that you will see when the actual episode comes out. So there is more Polymorphic therapy coming, I promise. I wanted to make sure the third one is epic.🫡

**Mark:** It will surely be special because it has everyone's favourite character.

All right, I think that covers everything. Is there anything else anyone has on their mind or wants to bring up before we hop?

Okay, everyone, we appreciate you all hit like and subscribe to all the stuff. 

We'll talk to you all soon. AMA week, and we'll be posting a project call in two weeks. 

So thank you, everyone, and we'll talk soon, guys. 💙✌️
