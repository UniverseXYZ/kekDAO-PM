## Intro

**Mark:** Hello, everyone. Welcome to Project Call number 34! 

We are going to go ahead and jump right into everything. 

I will pass it off to Ryan and Ilia to give marketplace development updates. 

## Marketplace & Development Updates 🖼 🧰 [[00:20]](https://youtu.be/cJGe2w4KRJo?t=20)

**Ryan:** Good morning, everybody. As you know, we're finishing up our 7th sprint and getting ready to start the 8th. I can finally say that we have successfully onboarded DevOps. Stan is getting everything together and prepared to move forward and overcome the last couple of months and what has been done in this last sprint. There has been a bunch of scalability and performance improvements, which we will be testing in the next sprint in preparation for their release. This includes various things like filtering by traits, and various speed improvements, along with the new database. The ERC 1155s support we discussed is finishing up, and it's going to be tested in the 8th sprint, again with the hope of releasing it at the end. That comes with a handful of UI improvements to the user profile and the My NFTs page, which is finished in the 8th sprint.

We have a few more things that we've been discussing, like the next JS integration into some of the other components. We've spoken about it specifically regarding search engine optimization and nice social links for the marketplace. We will expand that outside of the marketplace to the other Universe platforms we're working on, such as the auctions platform that will be kicked back off very shortly. Another major feature that's being worked on is the bundles. We've been working on how we want the bundles to work for the last sprint and getting everything ready to scope out. A lot of the development is finishing up, but it will take at least another sprint. That covers most of what was done in Sprint 8; some are carried over to the next sprint. I'll let Ilia hit on a few points.

**Ilia:** Ryan said everything regarding the Sprint 7 ending and what we want for Sprint 8. There are a few more items for Sprint 8. We're resuming the automation test work. We are doing an automated test of the core functionality, so when we develop, we have an easy way to check and see that we have not impacted any of the other work we already have on production. Stan, the new DevOps, has begun putting the new infrastructure in place. Our main goal is to have that set up for this sprint and start testing everything we've built for the past few months. I hope to kick off this sprint, which may carry to Sprint 9 and deploy there. We will need to see the progress day by day. I can't say the end date now, but we're hopeful things are in motion.

Hopefully, we will have more info for you on the next sprint call. 🏃💨

We can continue with the Polymorph updates. 

## Polymorphs 🤡

**Zach:** Good morning guys. 🌤 ☕️

We got the burn to mint live so you can go to the Polymorphs site Universe.XYZ and burn some Polymorphs. 

People enjoy the V2 3D versions; if you haven't yet, go check that out. In the timeline very short term, in the next two weeks or so, we will have Polymorphic faces to be claimed for anybody that has burned a Polymorph; you'll get a Polymorphic face on a one-to-one basis with the amount of Polymorphs you burn. In the midterm, we've got the Polygon Bridge for cheaper scrambling. Then a little bit longer term, we've got some gaming going on Battle Universe, then another different type of game for which we will have a demo. Then we will have another Deviance Drop, a Polymorph internal derivative style drop. 

**Ryan:** I have more for you on the Polymorphs, on the social side. We also have the Polymorph Club in the discord. If you're in the Universe Discord, you want to connect your wallet through Collab Land. If you have a V1 or V2 Polymorph, you will have access to the Polymorph Holders channel. If you own a Clown Charles, send Transmental or me a DM, and we will add you to the super-secret Clown Charles Twitter group chat.

**Zach:** I wanted to ask if anyone has any ideas on how you want to get involved in Polymorphic Therapy? I want to do some discord Polymorph competition at some point to get people's Polymorphs in line for the next Polymorphic Therapy episodes. I have some personal ideas, but it would be great to hear from the community how you guys want to compete for the opportunity to get featured on Polymorphic Therapy.

**Ryan:** If you're interested in that, start thinking about who your Polymorph is and why they are the way they are. 😏

**Mark:** What kind of issues they're going through, what they might need to talk to their doctor about. One other thing on the Polymorphs. This past week we had a proposal about the Polymorphic funds. I can let Tyler go into that because there was some feedback in the discord. We wanted to repeat that feedback so the people who don't always sit in discord can get that same information.

## Polymorphic Funds Proposal 🗳

**Tyler:** We have a multi SIG we used to fund runway and development. Everybody on this call isn't paid directly from the DAO. A multi SIG pays them. Most of that capital in that multi SIG has come from external groups and funds that have reached out. When we initially did the DAO, similar to what we did with Barnbridge. We earmarked a certain amount where we manage and go through budgets every month and figure out who needs to get paid what, so work on that project can continue. We had meaningful padding when we were doing work for the Polymorphs. It had been said in the discord before that we had never touched the Polymorph money; that was true from a DAO perspective. That wasn't people on this call. It was the community that noticed buckets of funds hadn't been touched.

As ETH has gone down in price, the number of funds that from the US dollar amount went down. We still spent meaningful amounts of money working on the Polymorphs, and a lot of that is starting to come out; the burn to mint cost capital from a smart contract perspective and the battle game has been audited. There's front-end, back-end development that goes into that. A bunch of art went into it, from the faces to the deviants to the 3D modelling of the Polymorphs. Naturally, many of the multi SIG's capital came from people highly interested in the marketplace. Since we had been using the multi SIG to fund the Polymorph development at this point, we decided that we didn't want to risk further degradation in the crypto market since that treasury was denominated in ETH. We asked the community to provide that to the multi SIG so everybody on the project can continue to work. We don't want to pay people directly in ETH; people have bills to pay and kids and families.

So getting some of the ETH maxi concepts of when we're selling, we still have to deal with real-world things, despite all of our conviction in crypto. One thing I'd also add for the community is. I saw messages around this being some degree of slush fund or late-stage market vote out. I can personally say I'm one of the two people that's been most active in managing the budget and looking at how we pay people. I've never taken a salary or a dollar out of Universe, so it's not some slush fund; it's not going to the founders, it's not going directly to my wallet. It's going to pay the people on this call, the people who aren't on this call that are busy coding, working on art, and designing things. Those people need to have comfort knowing that they can feed their families or they're going to look for other jobs. Not to bring this up on a call, but there's nothing nefarious.

It will be managed. Nobody takes a crazy salary at Universe. We're trying to ensure that everything can move forward in chaotic markets. The worst thing you can do for productivity is people looking at the market worried about their bags or whether the price of one token or another will affect their ability to feed their kids. There were questions about the runway, which I answered. We have enough runway to reach the point where we will have a functioning marketplace and start pushing this stuff out on the Polymorph side. From a macro perspective, costs are going up worldwide, and I don't know the exact month or date. We have been prudent about managing the runway up to this point, outside of people complaining about a party we spent $100,000 on. I would say that compared to other crypto projects, we've been extremely stingy and prudent with how funds have been paid.

I'm trying to be more transparent because people said they wanted more information. So that's what I'm giving right now. 🫡

**Mark:** I think we only have one more thing on the agenda. We're having a party on Sunday night. I can let Zach jump more into that and give more details. Zach, I would provide a complete overview. I know you've gone over some of the details, but because it's this week, lay it all out for everyone, so they have all the info in one place.

## NFT-NYC Party 🎪 — Monstercat & Universe.xyz Present: UNIVERSAL SPACE STATION [[00:00]]()

**Zach:** The party is Sunday the 19th at Webster Hall in NYC. 🎉 🗽

Polymorph and Lobby Lobster holders have free entry. It's exclusive to NFT holders. There are a couple of others that Monstercat has on the list. 

**Mark:** The Lobby Lobsters, some of the other Monstercat NFTs. I'm not sure which they are, but I know it's the Polymorphs. 

**Zach:** It's not on the flyer, but I know they have them on their list so you can get in with a Lobby Lobster.

**Troy:** How do people verify?

**Mark:** So there's a website.

**Zach:** The ticket website.

**Mark:** It's [Ticket Fairy](https://www.ticketfairy.com/event/Universal-Space-Station/). 

It's the same way we did it last year. We'll share the link in the bio of the YouTube call, and it'll be the same process. I don't think you'll get an NFT like you did last year, where Tim had that cool NFT he made. It will be emailed to you, and you will get in via email; you will have to use Wallet Connect and verify that you have the NFTs in your wallet before it's sent to your email.

**Zach:** We're going to have Polymorphs all over the place, and I made sure of it. They have some performers, Don Diablo, BT and Vendata. We are showing some Polymorphic therapy in between sets, so that would be fun.

**Mark:** It's going to be a great time, the last 🎉 was awesome, and it sold out. It's a different venue; Monstercat says it will be just as cool, if not more intimate, because it's a smaller venue. People said the last venue was too big for how many people they let in. We still are going to have art displays. Last year we had PAK and Too Much Lag and a lot of very cool NFT people there.

**Zach:** It's [Micha Johnson](https://twitter.com/Micah_Johnson3) from [AKU Dreams](https://twitter.com/akudreams). (The artist 🎧)

**Mark:** That's everything for the call. We will post the link for Ticket Fairy in the bio of the YouTube call and the discord for everyone. It should already be there, but we will repost it so everyone can go ahead and get on it. 

> Link for posterity: https://www.ticketfairy.com/event/Universal-Space-Station/

We will talk to everyone next week at our AMA. Hit like and subscribe, and we will talk to you all soon. Bye.
