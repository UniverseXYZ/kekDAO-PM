## Intro

**Mark:** Hey, everyone. Welcome to Project call number 14. 

## Minting 🥼 [[00:12]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=12)

**Mark:** We're really excited to have you guys back. We're going to jump into updates. We've been working pretty hard on developing all of our products. So I'll jump right into the minting. As some of you may know, we have started beta testing. Basically, we have about 200 to 300 beta testers working diligently to try and find bugs and front-end issues and make sure everything's working. So far, our internal team, we think, found most of them, and we haven't seen too many outsides of the external beta testing. So that's an excellent sign. 

Hopefully, we can get that out ASAP. That's going to be when we really feel comfortable with our testing, and we think that we've done a sufficient amount of testing, and we feel comfortable letting that out. For the most part, those people know who they are, and the beta testers already know who they are; they have been testing. Suppose anyone in the community thinks that they have been in the community a long time and maybe not have chosen one role but is still pretty active and wants to check that out. Definitely DM me. In that case, I can give that access to a few more people that I feel have been really involved and have been helping.

So kind of a reach out. If you feel like you got left out of that, reach out to me, and I can try to make that right, and we'll see if we can get you access. Then one more thing about the minting is that it will be our first product to launch. We kind of split auctions and minting up so we could get minting out to market because we had run into some hiccups with the auctions. Those hiccups were kind of more towards the last call. We've actually made a lot of progress in the auctions, but I'll let Ryan give those updates on the auctions.

## Auctions ⚗️ [[02:21]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=142)

**Ryan:** All three products are in development, and minting is taking the highest priority. That's going to be our next first protocol level release. We're all really excited for that to play out. I'm sure [Brantly.eth](https://twitter.com/BrantlyMillegan), and probably many others will be excited to hear that we've gotten some [ENS](https://twitter.com/ensdomains) integration built-in. I'm personally very excited about that, and of course all the great stuff our product is going to offer. 

The auction stuff is all coming together at the auctions and marketplace level, and the marketplace smart contracts are underway. What's cool is we're working on a lot of new features for the marketplace at levels of like, royalties and some other stuff I can't talk about yet. We are all very excited about that and hope to see some release coming out very soon.

**Mark:** To back up a little bit, too, we will be releasing the mint a little bit early. The minting, we feel, has enough cool new features going into fit that we can release that alone. The feedback of the minting testing, the beta testing artists, seemed very excited about some of the features that had come out. Even I can quote Transmental because it made me smile. As he said, I'm honestly so excited to start minting NFTs again. 

[Transmental](https://twitter.com/transmental) has been integral to our community for a long time. We greatly appreciate his feedback. As someone who mints NFTs, it was good to see them excited about these new features coming out.

Ryan, do you think you could also give us some updates on the marketplace and a little bit of that progress? Maybe something regarding timelines?

**Ryan:** Before I jump into that, you mentioned Transmental and his kind feedback about the minting flow. I've spoken to him a lot, and at one point, he was trying to learn solidity— as a photographer —to write personal smart contracts. He was under the impression that he wanted/needed his own contracts with his branding on them. I believe, in part, that was part of why he was very excited about this minting flow. Now Transmental can do all of that. Without needing to mess with solidity and accidentally leave a bug somewhere. That made me quite happy to hear— when he returned with that kind of feedback.

**Mark:** I think many artists in the community have been asking for this. It's going to be an inspiring time when they finally get that.

**Ryan:** Yes, 100%.

## Marketplace 🖼 [[05:03]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=303)

**Ryan:** In terms of timelines, I can't give any hard dates. 

As you said, the minting is coming out first. Then we'll release the auctions. After the auctions are out and everyone's excited, we'll start rolling out the marketplace. I wish I could give more hard deadlines, but the order of launch is about the best I can do for you guys right now.

**Mark:** We're working as hard as we can and as fast as we can, as some people may know. Some people may not. But the development process is just how it goes. You can fix one thing, and another thing can break, or it all gets fixed right then and there. It's really a lot harder to give out deadlines and say, we're going to be done this day and it never really ends up happening that way. That's just the development process. It can be annoying, but that's just how it is. 

We're working as hard as we can to get this stuff out to you guys. Our plan was to really try and get all of this out before NFT-NYC, and we're still hoping. We're not 100% sure that we will get all of our products out, but hopefully, we can; that's our goal. We'll try to stick to it if we can. We'll still be diligently working, trying to get these products out. They will get completely tested so that there are no significant issues when we're releasing. So that everyone has a safe environment to put their NFTs. People will know that they're not going to be risking their NFTs, sending them somewhere, putting them on our website.

That's something that we have really focused on, and we don't ever want to have a problem with losing NFTs or losing money on our platform. That's why all the testing is occuring. All the audits are necessary. As we said before, security is critical to us. (We take it very seriously) 

We take extra steps for increased security measures. Unfortunately, that means more testing, more audits, and more time. However, in the end, it gives us more secure products. More people will feel safe using them. In my opinion, it's 100% worth it— If it saves anyone stress or heartache. No one ever wants to lose an NFT or money. That's always an incredibly stressful time in anyone's life. It sucks when you send money to a contract. It can get stuck in there; that's even worse. I'll let Tyler kind of talk a little bit about NFT-NYC because it kind of was our hopeful timeline. But we're not entirely sure now.

## NFT NYC 🌃🖼 [[08:10]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=490)

**Tyler:** I mean, it passes down. We're working with the team and figuring out the artists. Tim has been doing a lot of work on that. Honestly, I don't want to give the wrong info because it changes. When you plan a party, that is a month from now, things change. I believe we should push Tim to create a medium post. Something outlining the details, so that way, when they're good, they're good. At the current time, people will need to start making plans. So we need to get on top of that.

**Mark:** We'll get to work, and I'm pretty sure we can give the main details. It's going to be in New York City, and it's going to be like one of the final events. We want it to be more like an ending bash to NFT-NYC. It'll be towards the end. I believe it was set to be November 4, but I think they added another day.

**Troy:** I want to talk about the dates.

**Mark:** Okay yeah, there are no dates as of now. The days are moving around according to NFT-NYC themselves. 

They're adding days and moving them around. We're not entirely sure what day it is, but the Polymorphs are going to be your ticket in. We're trying to figure out ways to make that seamless and easy. I believe the venue limit was about 26 to 2800 people. As of right now, anyone with a Polymorph is in. Based on wallet holders and venue capacity, we should be able to fit everyone. If you want to start making plans, you can reach out to the team. We have no idea where we're staying or any of those details. We'll find out a lot of that nearer to the event. We don't know a ton about it, but we're working on it. 

A lot of the information has been private, but we'll have to come out with a medium article very soon. We'll make sure everyone has the full details to make plans accordingly. I believe that's our major update for today. 

Does anybody have any additional comments or concerns that we left out?

**Mark:** Okay, well, I'm going to go into the community questions really quick and let's see what the community is asking of us today.

## Upcoming Newsletter 📰 [[11:00]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=660)

**Troy:** We are working on something that we haven't talked about yet. I'm working with Dre and Kate on this and a couple of others— regarding a newsletter. We're kind of fleshing out what we want it to look like, but it will focus on one artist. The other is kind of the NFT tech space. Right, because we're attacking it from multiple layers. We don't have much to say on it yet. However, wanted to let everyone know that a newsletter is coming. If you're going to sign up for that newsletter, you can go to the website. We don't have a release date yet, we're working on the beginnings of it. Hopefully, by the end of the month— we'll have something pretty concrete and a set schedule. I wanted to let everyone know about that.

**Mark:** Hey Dre, I think this is your first project call. If you want to say Hi to everyone and introduce yourself? Not to put you on the spot.

### Introduction: [Dre](https://twitter.com/Dre_Lew8) 👋 [[12:04]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=724)

**Dre:** Hi, everyone. I'm Dre. I've known Troy for a long time. 

My background is in production and producing. I've been producing different mediums for the past decade and come on as a project manager. I think we're going to do some exciting enhancements. Kind of push the medium of a newsletter— which can be pretty dull —forward. Hopefully, we make it more entertaining and interactive for everybody in the community.

**Mark:** I think we're going to be able to do it. I believe we have the right team to make a fun, interactive newsletter. The more cool stuff that comes out in NFT— like unique files —I believe the more we can introduce new things to newsletters. Making them a little bit better.

**Troy:** Even if we do a newsletter— this is kind of out there —but, we can release newsletters as NFTs. That would be cool and interesting. This is an idea I've been entertaining.

**Mark:** And they would be editions.

**Troy:** Yeah, exactly, they would be editions. I don't want to open up too much. But, yeah, that's what I believe. We can do this.

**Mark:** That would be sick.

**Troy:** We'll have more about this later.

**Mark:** We'll leave it at that. 

## Community Questions ❓ [[13:30]](https://youtu.be/otSaW_UN1MA?t=810)

**Mark:** We had one follow-up question. It's kind of an extended follow-up question. We may need to answer this in Discord. 

Still, it was the follow-up question last week about the private sales, the person didn't mean tornado cash when we brought up the tornado cash situation, but I believe they mean: trustless private NFT sales. And he's got a whole paragraph here. 

**Ryan:** I will say that OpenSea removed that feature, right? That's what I imagine he's talking about. 

> *You can no longer make a private sale and avoid the OpenSea retail fee.*

**Mark:** OpenSea takes a fee on your private sale. Do not trust them. 

Currently, I don't know how we will handle private sales like that. I don't believe we have that built in to V1 of the marketplace. We have talked about it internally. However, I'm not sure what we've decided. I'll choose not to answer at this time. We'll try to determine this as a team— I don't know which direction we're going. If OpenSea removed it, we should look into why they removed it. If they pulled it for legal reasons, we can look into that. If they removed it for personal reasons, maybe that's a market opportunity for us. (To allow private sales) 

I don't have any idea. We'll figure it out, and we'll make sure to be open with the community about how our private sales will work. I do agree, having trustless features in place to make private sales is crucial for this industry. Not to mention the general trading of NFTs. And other aspects we're interested in for the marketplace.

**For example:** Trustless trading of an NFT for another NFT. ([Peer-to-Peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer)) 

We've talked about those ideas. Nothing has been built out yet, but it's something we're interested in building and looking into. We are just trying to figure out the best and safest way to handle those from a contract perspective. 

I believe that's the majority of our updates. So everyone, thank you. Unless anyone has anything else to say. I'm good. Well, thank you for tuning in to project call number 14.
