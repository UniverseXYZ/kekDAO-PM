## Intro

**Mark:** Today we are giving access to the Marketplace. It is the beta.

**Tyler:** It's on the main net, and it is the live version of the Marketplace. If anybody goes on there and lists something for a ridiculous price and sells it, it will sell out of your real wallet. 

**Mark:** The link is in the Pre AMA, and Tyler sent the password and username. 

I'll resend the link one more time, so everyone here has it. I don't know why I didn't post it as a link, but that's the link. Time to answer these questions. 

## Pre AMA Questions [[]]() ❓

### **Question: James F**

When can we would be able to use the Marketplace?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** It's today. We're giving access to everyone today. I think we've smoothed out the majority of all the bugs. All the contracts are working as designed. One thing— not all of the NFTs are showing up. Our back-end scraper is still catching up. It has to scrape the entire blockchain over 6 to 7 years. There are a lot of NFTs; it's scraping the present and the past at the same time.

Older NFTs may not appear. Newer ones will. We're trying to go in to pre-load as many NFT collections as we can that we know people are interested in.We can prioritize them in the queue. We've already prioritized the top 230 all-time collections. We have a beta that is in good enough shape that everyone can start using it and start listing, buying NFTs there. We wanted to give early access to the people who joined this AMA today because we appreciate everyone who joins our AMAs.


**Ryan:** If you see NFTs that you think should be in the top 200 and aren't showing up, let us know, and we'll try to deal with that as quickly as we can. 

Then for other collections, we can have DAO Votes through snapshot to get it in very quickly. Otherwise, all new collections deployed will be going forward, and we'll still be scraping the chain going back. I know people want to get certain collections listed. 

Good ol' snapshot is going to be the best way to do that.

**Mark:** We didn't want to delay the scraper catching up because we don't know how long it would take. There are new NFTs minted every day. It's hard to determine the many unknowns. We know people are very interested in a decentralized alternative.

**Tyler:** It will eventually scrape all of them, though. 👑

**Ryan:** We'll have every NFT— 721, and 1155 scraped. It will take time. We have to process every single block in the blockchain.

**Mark:** So that everyone knows how this process is going to work from now on, now that the Marketplace is out; We're going to be rigorously moving to get the rest of the features out. 

We have many different contracts, and the UI is done. We need to release it in steps. It's just easier to scale everything this way. If something breaks we can diagnose it. 

> This is a bare-bones Marketplace; ideally all features release in a few months. 

You'll have bundled listings, floor bids. Genie or Gem, will be integrating with us soon. We have unique minting contracts.

I'll leave it at that. We are going to add anything that you see grayed out. We have more features that you don't even see in the UI right now. 

There's a lot to look forward to. 👀

### **Question: Resistance**

1. Wen new UI for airdrop? 
2. What is this collection about?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have the airdrop UI done. We just haven't implemented it, yet. 

The marketplace has been the priority. We'll try to get it launched next week. All we have to do is publish it. There are a few details to go over then we should be able to push that live.


### Question

What is Universe Singularity?

### Answer

That's the Universe Singularity Collection. That was our original; and that collection it's still live. There was a bug, and we needed to fix it. So we took the contract off, fixed the bug, and redeployed. There's nothing wrong with those NFTs. We needed to make a fix. We did, and that's a dead collection. 

### Question

Will voting will be incentivized? 

### Answer

The incentive for staking in the DAO is the pooled rewards. 

We don't incentivize you to vote. If you want to vote, it's up to you. **Your incentive to vote is wanting to improve the products and the DAO.**

> If you hold $XYZ for any other reason other than Governance— you are speculating on the token value vs voting power. 

This isn't a company— It's a DAO. We each have a say on what we all do and build. I think that's an awesome incentive. The team hasn't discussed voting incentives. The DAO has the ability to make that happen. We can probably put some systems in place, but we have to talk about that as a community. 

**Tyler:** I mean, everybody can push proposals forward if they're smart and make sense. We will support well designed proposals. 🦾

**Nick:** And a well-thought plan. You have to plan where those funds will be coming from. It needs to be well thought out and with a vision that aligns in the direction of our ethos. 🔑

**Mark:** I like the idea of giving POAPS for voting. We can take snapshots after every vote. We did take a snapshot after the last vote to launch the Marketplace, so we've thought about it. 

Obviously, we're going to do something with that list. [Zach's](https://twitter.com/transmental) already dropped POAPs, but it seems like not everybody got them. So we'll try and figure that out with POAP. It was something to do with their server, and it wasn't working the day that Zach tried to do it. 🤦 

### **Question:**

How many days away before I can upload a comic cover and sell ERC 1155?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're going to add ERC 1155. That's going to be something to come in one of the later iterations of the Marketplace. 

We're starting with ERC 721 and some basic Marketplace features. We have to scale it out first. We are making sure our releases don't break anything. 

Yes, 1155s are coming, and we're going to look at Layer 2 assets.  


### Question

Any plans to add ERC 20 tokens as payment options?

### Answer

**Mark:** Yes, we're starting with USDC-ETH, Wrapped ETH, XYZ, and DAI. 

If people want to see tokens get added, we can run that through governance. I'm sure many people will want to see tokens like Apecoin get added. Let's make those decisions through governance.

### Question

A feature request form?

### Answer

**Mark:** I tagged Rayne on your post, and he added a feature request form in the Pre AMA channel. 

> [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/j4yWGRaiMncDvNYh8)

We can also add that in the announcements channel.


## Shoutout: [Hal Finney](https://twitter.com/halfin)

**Tyler:** Shout out to Hal Finney for talking about NFT trading cards back in 1993.

> [Crypto Trading Cards](https://lists.cpunks.org/pipermail/cypherpunks-legacy/1993-January/001489.html)

**Tyler:** Hal Finney will only use Universe when he returns from the dead due to cryogenic freezing.

**Mark:** You heard it here first. Hal Finney is going to use Universe. 

### **Question:**

Do you plan on rewarding activities on the platform to boost its launch? It doesn't look like it, but better to ask. 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have plans, but we have not publicly said what they are.

**Tyler:** If we're going to do something, most likely, we incentivize listings because I've talked about this in-depth. 

OpenSea's monopoly is around their listings. If you even look at where Looks, Rarible is getting organic volume. It's from Gem. Over time, with our auctions and minting we'll get a fraction of their volume.

**Algy:** If I mute you, just tell us in the Pre AMA channel— if you want to come up and talk.

### **Question:**

What is the point of Universe Singularity?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Anyone can mint to that contract. Otherwise, you have to create your own collection. 

When you create your own collection, you're creating your own minting contract that only you can mint too. Many people in the industry asked for this a year ago, so we did it. It costs a little bit of money to deploy. 

The last time I was looking, it was $150 to $250 to deploy 1 of those contracts. When you mint with it, it's $30 depending on the network. If you want to mint directly to that Universe Contract, you can. It's like the Rarible Contract where you can easily mint. 

### Question

Could we add more messaging around the decentralization aspect?

I think many people would move their NFT over if some were messaging around it?

### Answer

**Tyler:** Well, I think we should is the short answer. 

Why do you think that it would get people to move over? I think that's how we need to be approaching what the messaging contains.

**Mark:** We are looking into making a video explaining how Universe is decentralized. 

We've already started it. We'll try to release a 2-3 minute video on all the aspects of decentralization and Universe. One of the people who do those videos for us is Ivan, he actually lives in Ukraine, and he hasn't been making many videos at the moment. He's been able to edit some of them, but we've been giving him a little bit of a break because of what is going on over there.

### **Question:**

Aavegotchi incentivized voting by rewarding in-game XP for participation. (leading to in-game stat boosts).

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Interesting.

**Tyler:** Send us a link on how that works.

**Mark:** Yeah.

**Tyler:** Again, incentivizing voting is tough. I think it has to be even more than voting right now. Getting listings on the platform is very important.

### **Question:**

Will Universe have a similar token staking mechanism— Like LooksRare? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, we're not. If the DAO wanted to vote and do something like that, we could decide that through governance as a community. But the team will not set anything like that up on our own. But good question. Many people ask that. 

### **Question:**

What about a Doc or channel for requested collections? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** In Discord, that wouldn't be a bad idea. 💭

**Rayne:** I can make another form for that. So it doesn't just get cluttered.

We can make a super small form that people can send the contract address to, and then we can query it and see if we should add it.

**Mark:** We can make a channel and put that form as the only thing there— don't let people type.

**Rayne:** Yeah, I'll put that in the Discord. Maybe we move project requests and feature requests to a specific channel.

They do something like this at Rarible— or they did before.

**Mark:** Sorry for the delay, guys. We're trying to set that up quickly. 

### **Question: Fluffer Nutter**

Can I have an option to get paid for my NFT in more than one token? 

Like list my NFT for 4 ETH or the equivalent of XYZ, can receive a combo of both or the full amount in either token. 
 
#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, you can't. 

If you guys want to do that, we can make a contract that allows you to do that; that's tough. We would have to upgrade the contracts to include that feature. I can't answer that question because I don't know if that is possible. I'm unsure if we can upgrade it willy-nilly like that. 

Ryan, Is it possible to get paid for an NFT and multiple tokens? Like if someone wanted to get paid 4 ETH, but someone wanted to offer 2 ETH and then 20,000 XYZ— to make it simple math.

**Ryan:** I think we can support that without a smart contract upgrade using ERC20 bundles. I'd have to look into it, but I think it could be possible.

**Mark:** Okay, well, there's your answer. That's a great question. Fluffer Nutter.

**Ryan:** We can always do a DAO vote. So nothing's off the table.

### **Question: James F**

You all brought up additional functionality for $XYZ in the past. 

What's the plan on that? 

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** There is planned utility. We'll leave it at that. We do have plans, and no, we're not going to say it yet, when all that stuff is ready, it's going to be badass.

**Troy:** I can talk a little. 

The new [Graviton](https://graviton.xyz) website launched, and there's some information on there. The token will be mined through a live streaming service, and anyone who contributes GPU power to this system will be able to mine XYZ. I'm going to leave it at that. 

There's some other stuff we're working on, but I can't talk about it. 🤐

**Mark:** Thanks, Troy.

**Troy:** Hey, man, any time.

### **Question: Navi**

What can the community do to help at University succeed the most? 

For example, like listing migrations? Is it better if we cancel other listings? 🧐

#### **Answer:**

**Mark:** The best thing that anyone can do for Universe, right now— test the Marketplace and give us your honest and best feedback. 

We want to hear from you guys and what the community wants. We're here to accept criticism. Another thing that anyone can do is tell your friends about us, like a retweet, follow, and share our socials. There a decentralized competitor in the space coming, and we have been building for the last year.

OpenSea has quite the monopoly on listings. That's why their volume is so crazy. Moving some listings over, telling your friends, explaining that we're a decentralized alternative, giving your best feedback back to us, and how can we improve to help the Marketplace and help Universe will do wonders. 

**Ryan:** Let me bounce off you, Mark, on this— inform the community we're a DAO, you can participate in the direction. Another thing, anyone with collections that aren't showing up— and there's going to be several at first —let us know. 

It's will get better and better. We can start making proposals, and they will get pulled in quickly after that. That's how everyone can help. It's an actionable way to help the Marketplace— it bootstraps our data scraper.

**Mark:** I think that's an excellent point. We buy a lot of NFTs, but we don't buy all of them. There are cool collections we don't even know about that people love. 

Ping us. We're adding a channel for collections to get added. Rayne is working on that, and we'll be able to prioritize those collections that people care about the most. The scraper will eventually catch up and all the NFTs will get displayed.

### **Question:**

Will each collection project needs to update the information on each collection? 

### **Answer:**

**Ryan:** Each project has to update its royalties. 

If you want royalties on a collection you own, you can update royalties on the collection page. If there is no collection page, you can reach out, and we'll help it get all set up on the side of collection descriptions and names. For now, you can update them manually on our site on the Marketplace Alpha link. If you update it now, it'll stay alive. We will be pulling in more descriptions and names of collections, images, etc. 

For now, you'll be able to update them at least.

**Mark:** We will tweet to have collections reach out to us. 

You can also help by talking with project founders— If you're close, tell them, Universe is dropping. Let them know you can get them in touch with Mark, Ryan or Tyler. Message us and link us together with them because the Bored Ape team is not easy to get in touch with. We don't want collections like that to feel like they got burned because people went and were trading, and they hadn't set up their royalties. 

Speak up in your favourite Discords and invite them to our Discord and fill out one of those forms. Or get them in a chat room with us, we can do our best to guide them and get everything set up for custom collections.


### **Question:**

Is the best way to coordinate marketing strategy by making proposals via DAO? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Everyone asks about marketing. 

What do you guys want? You want to do paid Twitter ads? Tyler and I used to run a marketing agency, and we don't think that spending money on marketing is like doing commercials.

**Ryan:** Maybe we can come up with something creative. 

You can probably chat in Discord about it first and maybe make a forum proposal. Then once there's an idea formulated on exactly what you'd want to do and what kind of budget it's looking like, you could put that up for a snapshot vote and then an on-chain vote. 

I don't have any ideas on that front, I'm only highlighting how you would go if that is an avenue you want to contribute towards.

**Mark:** We are expanding our social media range to other platforms outside of Twitter. We have almost 25,000 followers on Twitter. We've never bought a follower. Organic growth in this industry outpaces trying to pay for clicks. Or, if you guys want, we can start promoting our tweets on Twitter.

**Tyler:** We've never bought a single crypto-based ad. Only word of mouth; word of mouth works better. 

I know many people in this Discord and are major FLUF fans on this AMA. If we can get all the FLUF people to list everything from the FLUF ecosystem— on Universe, that would help a lot. If you have a Polymorph for sale on OpenSea, relist it on Universe. You only have to approve the Polymorph contract once, and then you can list everything with a signature. Even if you want to list 20 Polymorphs. You're going to pay a $9 fee to approve the Polymorphs, and then you can relist all of them on Universe.

We don't have much to build on if we can't win against OpenSea with major projects. (FLUF Ecosystem) 

Talking to communities close to us, ones who built with us in many ways. Some of the attachment and the synergy even legitimized us in the early days when we rolled up our sleeves and tried to help everyone. I would like it if a lot of those projects return the favour. I can tell their founders that, but it's a big difference if people in their community list on Universe.

**Mark:** We're talking with those guys; we're super aligned with Aaron and David and that whole ecosystem.

**Tyler:** Right. But it's one thing for me to talk to Aaron and David. It's another thing for active people because I can't be active in the FLUFs Discord. As much as I love FLUFs, I have much other stuff on my plate. But people who are active in that Discord are active in flipping NFTs.

**Mark:** Yeah, it's going to be a battle. 

### **Question:**

Is the Universe Foundation planning to raise more institutional money at some point, or are we done?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** The Universe doesn't have a foundation. 

We're at a good spot in terms of funding at the Multi SIG. We'll have some creative ways to do it over time if we want to get more capital in the treasury to compensate people working on the project. We can pay attention to some of what happens at the rollout of Barnbridge and their DAO. We can play it by ear. Right now, we're not undercapitalized. We're under-talented. We always need more talent. I don't think capital is the issue right now.

### **Question:**

How are we moving FLUFs and associated projects over? 


### **Question: avgmayosandwich**

**Mark:** There's a button on the FLUFs website that is a view on OpenSea. We can talk to Aaron about getting that switched from OpenSea to Universe. (or adding an additional button)

**Tyler:** Even some of our stuff like Enter DAO and Sharded Minds. We should definitely get to them to list on Universe.

**Mark:** I've already talked to David and Aaron about this. Our ecosystem partners, like Enter DAO, the FLUF Burrows. There are a lot of cool items.

This is important. When you have an ASM brain, you're going to be able to put it in a FLUF. You're going to be able to do all this other stuff. I've already talked to David, and I said we can put buttons on the Marketplace that say "put this brain in another NFT". Maybe button that brings me directly to my burrow? I don't have to go to the underground, click through all this stuff, and go to my burrow. I have it right here. Boom. Click and go there. 

People are going to want to use Universe because we can easily integrate the underground into our Marketplace. Even Enter DAO can rent an asset out of the front end. That's one thing that many people may not realize. Any NFT minted on Universe Contracts is compatible with Enter DAO and Land Works. You can rent any NFT. You could rent out your Polymorph for a party or something.

**Tyler:** That will be important when it comes to gaming. One thing I was going to say is that I just hired a UI/UX person who I'm going to start designing figmas of a Marketplace. I don't know their tech stack, a custom Marketplace for certain projects, and flipping them to the founders of those projects. It's not like we can code them for them. But if we get to that point and that's successful, maybe we start coding them and open source them and give them away. 

Realistically, if FLUFs had a Marketplace on their site, it's likely going to be Universe because we'll probably help them build that. I would say the same with Sharded Minds. Enter DAO is going to build into it. We go to Polygon like League DAO, and I've even talked to Fractional, and we could probably do something like that with Charged Particles. We need to get as many listings as possible. And that is one of the ways that I think will work to do that. 

**Mark:** We're thinking of this for our NFTs, you're going to be able to scramble your Polymorph from the Marketplace. 

**Troy:** That's where the whole finders fee comes in. You can build out your own interface on top of the Marketplace, and that's a big incentive. Then the front end can also take a cut, and those types of features should end up more over on their sites. And then they plug in almost like plugging into a back end to our Marketplace, and that's where that stuff starts to get interesting.

**Mark:** Just to access liquidity.

**Troy:** Exactly.

**Mark:** Super interesting.

**Troy:** Graviton's working on something like that. Some of the applications that are being built will use Universe Marketplace, but there'll be a front end built on top of it. Graviton, the company, takes a finder's fee, but everything gets listed on the Universe Marketplace, and you'll be able to find it on Universe Marketplace. You'll also be able to find a specific collection. 

I'm not going to say what that is yet, but it will be listed on the front end of Graviton. But it will still be using Universe's Marketplace, and there will be a fee-sharing system— that's where that finder's fee exists. The collection front end that uses the Marketplaces back end, that front end takes a cut, but then a share goes to the Universe Marketplace, so they don't have to build their own on-chain liquidity system. If you think about it, it's how Uniswap works, which we've been saying. This is the Uniswap for NFTs.

### **Question:**

Hardware wallet timeline?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** That is something we're working on. 

We're trying to get it live insanely quick. We are sorry about the bug. We're having an issue with signatures on the hardware wallets. Even with the Metamask integration and Ledger, the devs are working on it right now. We will solve that. We're trying to tweak out some of these final nuances. However, we think that we are in a place where we could share this with everyone. 

If everyone can help us test a little more we'd apprecuate it. 

### **Question:**

Can we keep the Google sheet open for additional feedback?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We have a Google form; we will leave form open. 

> [Google Form: Project Request](https://forms.gle/YuAihMh6VjATdPKq5)
> [Google Form: Marketplace Feedback](https://forms.gle/Rj3fHVkkJcVuwLsc8)

People can come and constantly try to add future requests, and we'll be going through those, and we'll decide through there. If we get many of the same feature requests, we'll create a snapshot proposal, and the community can vote on it.

We're not just going to go and enact every feature that gets requested. If there are bugs, we need to fix the bugs, but feature requests are going to be handled a little bit differently than bug requests.

### **Question:**

Will Universe freeze NFTs if they report it stolen?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think we can freeze NFTs, but we can pull them off our front-end interface. Are we not going to freeze any NFTs? 

**Tyler:** That's a Ryan question because I don't know the legality.

**Ryan:** The legality is that we have to take them off the front end.

If you want to plug into our back end.

We can't stop you.

**Tyler:** I don't think OpenSea can do that either, to be honest. I believe they are just freezing it on their front end. Maybe part of the giving permission to OpenSea allows them to do that, but I think my gut says they're just freezing on their front end. But I don't know how OpenSeas Contracts work because they're not open source. Maybe when you approve something on OpenSea, it gives them the ability to do that. And if that's true, that's not good that a centralized tech company owns that power. 

Our smart contracts don't give us the ability to freeze NFTs. But if something nefarious happens and the FBI shows up at my house, it is coming off the interface, not going to jail for people doing stupid 💩 on Universe.

**Ryan:** anything illegal will be pulled from the front end. Beyond that, we can have DAO Votes if people want to have certain content pulled. I don't have any clear specifications around how it would look, but we can't stop things moving through the contracts.

**Tyler:** I think that was what he was asking. He was saying that's his point. We will pull it off. If we get DCMA, we're going to comply. 

That's not our legal battle to fight on behalf of the industry. Go ahead if you want to launch your own Marketplace and plug into our protocol. But we're not going to show it on ours if we have to respond to a DCMA because otherwise, they'll just hit Amazon with the DCMA and the whole Marketplace goes down. This isn't pure anarchy. We still have to live by the rule of law. 

I think it's a good question because I have never considered how sketchy that is that OpenSea can freeze people's property.

**Mark:** I think they can move NFTs, too.

**Ryan:** Yeah. I don't want to speculate on what OpenSea can and can't do just because I'm not 100% sure.

**Tyler:** We can tell you what we can do, and I mean, trust and verify. You can look for yourself at the contracts or open source.

**Ryan:** Right. I think creators should not worry about their content being pulled one day. If, for some reason, your content is questionable or up for debate, whether it's graphic or whatever it may be. People want to have a vote around it; you'll have the opportunity to have a say and come up with a reason why you believe it should stay and should get displayed on Universe. It is up to the community because it's a DAO and that's how I think it should be. I think everyone agrees, or I would hope so.

### **Question:**

Are there future plans for Metaverse collaborations? Get NFTs Land listed on Universe Marketplace?  

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Like the FLUF Burrows, we talked about adding a button to allow you to jump right in. 

I don't understand why Metaverse Land doesn't already have more buttons for accessability. Crypto Voxels, you can go and click on the link on OpenSea, and then it brings you to Crypto Voxels. I think you should have a button that just deploys you directly into that piece of property. You could do a 360 walk-through, the same way people do real estate viewings now because of Covid. We're going to try to integrate cool stuff like that. That puts you through a portal to where you need to be. We're going to partner with them and do our best to do what they want because I'm sure these projects want added features that we haven't even thought of. So we'll see what they want to do as well. We do have plans to collaborate with a lot of different groups.

We're a liquidity layer protocol for the Metaverse. We have built the contracts that you can now plug into. You can now buy something off the wall, and these CryptoVoxels— we can integrate our backend there. They can create a widget now in the Metaverse, which will connect to our smart contracts. You'll be able to make a sale in the Metaverse. Some of you Metaversians know, you have to leave CryptoVoxels or other Metalands to make sales. I think it's powerful being able to buy something off the wall. Our smart contracts are something that will make that possible.

### **Question:**

Will there be a dark mode? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We'll have a dark mode. There's a dark mode in the design. Dark mode is on the way.

**Algy:** We should have had that pushed at launch. I don't know why we didn't.

**Mark:** Technically, we're not even launched right now. People have access to the beta. This is an early look; I mean, this is bare bones. I'm not going to lie. We don't want people trying to front-run us on what we've done. Tim Kang has been crushing it on writing. He's the smart contract, God. He has created some creative and interesting minting contracts that we will be plugging in soon. We have 3 or 4 types of NFT minting that nobody has ever seen before.

**Tyler:** Someone bought my ETH Lizard during this call— from Universe.

**Mark:** Welcome to the ETh Lizard family. I changed my background to an ETH Lizard today.

**Ryan:** That's the first sale on the Marketplace from the community. 

**Mark:** Let's go. Tyler GG 🎉

**Ryan:** The DAO earned .005 ETH fees or something like that. You're on the team, fella.

**Mark:** Okay, thank you, Fluffer Nutter, for listing your FLUFs. We appreciate you, but honestly, if you're selling FLUFs, you're probably not going to make it. 

But I know you have probably 30 FLUFs. Maybe you should consider it; I guess listing them will help. Okay, everyone can help by speaking up a bit about the power of Universe XYZ. We're a DAO, all of us are in control, and we're in this together. We're going to build this Marketplace together. We built the bones. Let's get the flesh going. We can't do it by ourselves at this point. We need the community to help push this thing. The best marketing is having people with a large following on Twitter that are legit. We have some legit people that we can have promote the Marketplace.

### **Question:**

Is Universe going to offer a borrow against your NFT feature? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** No, we are not. 

Maybe we can integrate something like that. We can use someone else's API and plug it into our interface if someone else wants to. We weren't going to build a borrowing platform for NFTs. 

### **Question:**

When is the Android and Apple App? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** JWe were going to build an app, and we stopped. We decided it was not worth the time, effort, or money. The reason is because if you see the OpenSeas app, it's a view-only app. It's not going to drive sales. 

There are rules that you can't sell things regarding crypto on the Apple Marketplace. They have all these weird laws, and you're violating the rights to their contract agreement and all this stuff. Gnosis Safe got into a legal suit with them, and it seemed like more of a headache to try and build this thing.

That's partially why OpenSea is just view only. Right now, we're staying away from it. But if things change with Apple, which I don't see happening unless they want to allow more crypto adoption. Still, it's more of a barrier to entry because of our industry to build an app that functions the way we would want to build it.

**Algy:** Hypothetically, though, we could create an app to display cool stuff for you guys that pull you to a browser on your phone if you did want to buy something.

**Mark:** That might be alpha, but what would I know? Okay. 

Too much overhead to keep it up to date with all the devices and bare functionality. A view-only app is going to be much cheaper to build than a fully functioning app. At one point, we were trying to figure out the legal stuff. And realized, this is too much jumping through hoops to figure this out. And then, if we do somehow figure it out, Apple could just shut us down at any minute. It's not as much about the cost; It's more, where do we need to focus? And is this a priority? Is this going to drive Universe?

If the community wants it, we can talk about it. I'm all for it. We already decided we didn't think it was necessary.

**Algy:** There probably won't ever be an app for the Marketplace. 

I'm not going to leak alpha; all I'm saying is that I'm personally in favour of an app release. But it definitely won't be one where you can buy NFTs on it. And it won't be like the OpenSea one either, where it's just a fork of our Marketplace. If we were to release an app, it would provide insight.

Having your wallet on your phone— that's a security risk. Us releasing an app insinuates that you should have your wallet on your phone. It's better for these apps on their phone to be view only because you're not putting your wallet at risk. Having your wallet on your phone is bad advice. 

**Tyler:** Sylo is an app, and they'll probably integrate into Universe. The truth is anyone on this call who can build something could probably legitimately raise VC funding and build an application and take a finder's fee by plugging into Universe if you all want real alpha. If I didn't have so much else on my plate, if I was going to start a company, I'd probably do that and have that application be a wallet that could plug in the Universe.

### **Question:**

Will XYZ Marketplace be crypto-only, or are there plans to integrate credit cards, PayPal, other legacy types of payments or is this a regulatory headache for now? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're not a company, and we can't accept US dollars. 

A few businesses were set up around Universe that could potentially explore those options. We'll accept USDC and DAI— crypto forms of the US dollar.

**Tyler:** Some people are working on that.

**Mark:** We have some plans of ways that we might be able to do it, but Universe will not be. We may be able to set something up so that we can offer that, but it won't be Universe XYZ DAO accepting the money. 

### **Question:**

Besides XYZ, Eth and Weth, what other currencies will be used.

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** You also have USDC and DAI as currencies that will be used. 


### **Question:**

What's the fee? How is the fee decided?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** Then 1.69% is the fee for the Marketplace. 

We decided that because what better to do when you build a dope ass Marketplace— you put a cherry on top, right? That's a meme, a little 69. We were going to do 69420, but we wanted to make it simple.

### **Question:**

What is the vesting schedule for the remaining tokens? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I think it's 104 weeks, and we're in week 30. 

It hasn't even been a year. We'll say 30 something. Off the top of our head is what week we're in out of like 100-104.

### **Quesiton:**

When decentralization video?

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** I'll talk to Ivan, and we'll see if we can get that cranked out in the next few weeks. And Zach and I will work on all that copy and get our Founders to review it and make sure everything is to T, and we will get that out to you guys.

### **Question:**

I have a question for someone. This lindy person asked something that I didn't understand. Access points to the wallet, Zapper, Rainbow Wallet, etc. All that. 

### **Answer:**

**Algy:** We're on Zapper already. I'm not saying that that's answering your question, but I'm wondering what is your vision for integration with Zapper or Rainbow Wallet? 

**Mark:** I know what he's asking. So let me just answer this. Genie and Gem are about to integrate with us. And I was at a party a few weeks ago, and I met some of the OpenSea guys, and I even mentioned to them we'll give anybody a founder's fee if they plug into our liquidity. The OpenSea guys seem interested in plugging into our liquidity and bringing more listings to their Marketplace. That's not a set in stone thing. But we are having those conversations with other Marketplaces and other three teams like Gem and Genie. So that founder's fee is super powerful, and that comes out of the Universe fee, that comes out of our pocket, not anyone else's. But we think that's going to drive much liquidity. If OpenSea was to plug into our protocol and they have a listing or sell one of our listings, we both would make something from that. That needs to be the angle is anybody can plug into the Universe. I don't see why they wouldn't want to.

**Algy:** Yes. I guess what I was wondering is; What would Zapper do? You go on Zapper, and you can trade your NFTs on Zapper.

**Mark:** You're saying you could build a front end that you could build an NFTs version of Zapper that plugs into universal liquidity. You can build your own Marketplace for your own NFT project and list it through the Universe protocol contracts, and it's going to get listed on Universe. Then if OpenSea is plugged into that contract, too, it'll get listed on OpenSea. So that's the power of the protocol is, listed in one place, and it gets listed everywhere. In sales, most people are; you need all points of contact. What if you list 1 NFT on 1 Marketplace protocol, and it lists it on 6 Marketplaces? It doesn't matter where that NFTs get sold if it's getting sold on Universe's contracts. That's what we built. We didn't just build a Marketplace like OpenSea, and we are going to give all those docs out; we have them published. I don't think they're published, but we'll push published soon, and anyone will have those APIs. If you guys have any projects that you all want to plug into the liquidity, you can reach out to Ryan and me, and we can try to get you guys some of those endpoints.

### **Question:**

Will there be rarity charts for all collections or just universe collections?

### **Answer:**

**Tyler:** We should give a grant to the first project that builds and opens sources and documents, launching a custom Marketplace Universe. We should give a grant in XYZ, the first project.

**Algy:** I think that makes sense, Tyler. Tyler says we don't vote on it, but that's a good idea.

### **Question:**

How will you decide which NFTs show on the home screen? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** All right, this is something that we have not decided on as a team.

**Algy:** It's going to be community-based. The decision is a way that's not exploitable. We need to make sure we come up with a way that isn't exploitable, where people can take advantage of the system that we set up for it and get past people who deserve organic promotion and stuff. We don't want it to be where we're just cherry-picking the projects that we just bought and pumping our bags. We want it to be fair.

**Mark:** We don't want another Nate situation where people will be like you guys were picking NFTs. We'll just openly let the community decide which ones, and then no one will front-run anyone because it'll just be public information in the Discord or whatever, where people are like, oh, we're going to add this one. Let's add this one. Then everyone agrees. 

### **Question:**

Then your next question about; How projects will be verified? 

### **Answer:**

**Mark:** We're honestly not going to verify projects. We're going to start letting people. Hopefully, they're not. Nick, stop, bro. We're not verifying the projects. You're going to have to verify the contract address. We will not verify anyone in the first few months of this. If the community wants us to start verifying projects, we will vote. But we had this conversation before. We don't want to play favouritism. Also, we think that people need to be verifying contracts you want to verify a collection, check the chain because that's the safest and best way to do it. Learn how to read Etherscan and find a valid contract, and verify. You go into the Board Ape Discord. They have that contract address pinned.

I don't care if an NFT collection is verified on OpenSea. You should still be going and checking the chain and making sure that that's not a fake verification badge. A front end is easily exploitable. We've talked about this, and it might not be people's favourite answer that we're not going to verify this, and we might sound like crazy people, but that's how you verify an NFT by the contract address.

**Algy:** Yeah, but eventually, Mark is probably right; at first, there won't be a system. And what Nick tried to bring up just now is something about that product that we keep leaking the name of and don't explain. And it was Temple. We have ideas for this voting process, and that's not what Temple is. It was just something that we talked about through that. But we have this idea for this voting process that happens fully on a snapshot. I'm going to explain it. Anyone who holds XYZ will be able to make a proposal to get a collection verified. Then anybody who has XYZ can vote to get it to verify that collection. If it passes a quorum, it gets verified. This is the best community-based method we've come up with so far that can't be exploited. But yeah, as Mark said, we probably won't release anything until we know that it actually can't be exploited. And it actually will work. Right, because it's hard to test stuff like this without trial and error. And we don't want you guys to be guinea pigs.

We want to make sure whatever we put out for this verification because that's a big topic in any social media or entertainment anywhere. After all, NTS is entertainment. So at this point, we need to make sure we're not even going to use a checkmark badge because it doesn't fit our aura or brand or anything. If we do verification, it will be community-based, and it can't be exploitable. We're not going to be saying, Mark and I decided we're going to verify this project today. That's not happening. It has to be on-chain, in some aspect or retrievable somehow.

**Mark:** If you all want to verify collections, we can. I'm just saying I'm not the one who will do it. Our team is not showing favouritism to any collections. We're not verifying FLUFs; we're not verifying ASM brains. It's just that we're not getting into this situation.

**Add Speaker:** For now. We do advise, like Mark said, that always check on-chain, double-check the project's social media pages and websites to find their actual contract address and double-check on Etherscan and Universe. It's the right contract address because people will be minting. They're going to have free reign to mint on our platform. And once they mint, our scraper will pick up those NFTs immediately. So those will be the ones showing up on the University Marketplace. Just always double-check. We're going to be trying our best. We have a report button. If you see fake pages and fake NFTs, you can report them, and we'll take them down because we don't want fake.

**Mark:**  But the thing is, How do you make it decentralized? And you got to think about like this is part of why we're not starting with verification is because we have absolutely no way to truly decentralize it with us just figuring out how it works. We need to figure it out as a community. And that was my point. It's like we aren't going to have verification. People will have to check the chain, and we'll figure it out as a community.

**Algy:** Well, the strategy, we only had XYZ holders voting and creating proposals that are not exploitable, but that one works. We don't want to make that the way we do it. Then ten days later, we realized there was a better way. So yeah, it's like our Marketplace. We don't want to just release anything off of our first impression, thinking that we came up with the best idea because that will happen in the community. I know people who were excited about this one FLUF drop, and I'm not going to change, and that it happened. But then it happened, and then everybody was you guys did that wrong. And it was the same people saying we did it wrong where the same people saying right before that was the way we should do it, and they were excited. So I feel like we're trying to plan where we don't all agree, even though the community agrees. And then ten days later, we're all like, that wasn't the best way to do it. We should have done this. We want to avoid that in every situation when we release anything because that can happen.

Everyone is saying community verification is great. Gunner pointed it out. It can't be bootable. I think the way that we have come up with is not bootable but is it fair? I don't know if it's fair to make everybody hold one token to vote, but maybe it is. So we just got to consider it more. I think of what Mark is saying about the whole contract address. Eventually, we will have to have a way to make it easier for people to know what's legit and what's not. Since anyone's going to be

**Mark:** The way it's legit is the contract address of the collection.

**Algy:** Yes, I've been on these AMAs recently. It's been at least a month now. But Ledger was hosting AMAs repetitively in the last month, and it was because people were Bored Ape kept getting scammed and what they would say over and over. One of the kids even knew the contract address by heart, so they would say you need to be verifying his contract address. It's so easy to know you're not getting scammed in NFTs if you just look at the contract address. One of the Ledger Founders doesn't own a Board Ape and knows the contract address by heart because he's had to help so many people who got scammed and didn't even realize this. So I think that Mark's 100% right, that it's just such an easy thing for people to know. Crypto's whole point if you have the people developing hardware wallets even saying it. You're supposed to be understanding how Etherscan works and see how the contract is addressed. I think Etherscan, personally, though, could do a better job too. In MetaMask. What if when you went to buy a Board Ape, MetaMask and Etherscan were like had a name like this is the real Board Ape collection.

Maybe even showed its volume on one of the websites. There are so many ways that MetaMask themselves could upgrade the UI. Ledger is something they're prioritizing. They want to make it so that the UI for new users explains stuff to where you don't even need it to be verified on OpenSea because on MetaMask and the transaction, it's telling you this contract address is this item. So I think that one of the biggest things is that we're going to have verification, and it will be community-driven. We're not going to rush into it. But Mark's right. Overall, we do need people to learn what a contract address is. And if you're saying that the community is not smart enough to do that, that's what's not good. You guys are saying it's not good that we don't have verification right away. But what's not good is that the community is so open to getting scammed. People need to learn more.

**Add Speaker:** That's what's not happening. That people are so willing to jump into this without learning. People need not do that as much. It makes it hard for me to recommend crypto to people and stuff because I'm always afraid until we get past this where you recommend crypto to your friend, and then there's a chance of getting scammed, which is happening not because of OpenSea. It's happening because MetaMask does not have a good interface that explains to people what the transaction they're signing is. In my opinion, that's like the biggest cause of it. Until there are upgrades on that end, I don't think that there's any chance that it even will matter. People will still get scammed whether we have a check or not, the same way because they don't know that they can look at a number on Etherscan and see it's the right one.

**Mark:** You are trying to ask something. 

**Community Member:** I was going to ask, where can we put feature requests? I guess not the Marketplace feature. I guess it is a Marketplace feature request for verification. Where can we push something to go ahead and propose a difference. Thank you. I'll go ahead and put something up.

**Mark:** Thank you, sir. We appreciate you.

**Algy:** Do you know what this person just said? He said that he doesn't know how to check the contract address just because you're saying that I'm going to start annoying our team and that we should make a video that explains how to check the contract address. I'm going to annoy our team until they make that video because that's huge. People need to know how to check that. Do you know what I'm saying?

It could be a five-second video because

**Mark:** I didn't mean to sound like a Dick when I was like, yeah, people are going to f---ing have to learn this s--t.

**Algy:** We want to help them learn. 

**Mark:** I walk in front of people, and they ask me, what do you think the NFT space needs? And I say, I think we need more education. This is financial technology. People have been building in DeFi. Many of us learn how to use DeFi, but we're talking about Artists, and they may not understand what is happening here. We should be educating people on how to protect their assets and that if you just click on a file, your assets are at risk and then it sucks. I heard someone say a few weeks ago; that it's like getting robbed in cryptos. Your baptism in crypto, it's like, dude, that's f---ing bulls--t. This happens to everyone. I've never been hacked. I feel really bad for people who get hacked, but at the same time, you got to learn how to do this. It sucks that you have to get burned to learn. But it shouldn't be that way. It really shouldn't. We should be trying to educate people on this. Tim has ideas on how we educate people in this space. I have ideas, but we can't educate everybody.

And that's the thing that sucks, is we have to lean on each other. But checking the contract address shouldn't be this huge thing. That should just be something that we do, even if it's verified. If you go to OpenSea, you should still be checking that s--t just in case someone was able to hack their front end and make it look like this was a verified collection and people were buying Board Apes or something. It's not that hard to hack a front end. It depends on which front end, I guess. But I wasn't trying to be a dick when I said that. I just said I don't think it's a lot to ask for people to verify. Go to an extra link and verify on Etherscan. But maybe I'm being inconsiderate.

**Community Member:** There's a really good feature that comes with or at least makes it easy if you go ahead and get a grid plus wallet. Suppose you get a grid plus wallet. It lays out exactly what you're interacting with. And then you can go ahead and highlight it. Then you can just check to make sure on either scan that's the exact one you're interacting with.

**Algy:** We're going to have it on our Marketplace, so when you're viewing your NFTs or Collections, there is an easy way to navigate without hitting any extra buttons to get to the contract address on our testing. I know some of you guys are testing on our testing. This isn't set up fully yet. It is on the page end, but we still need to update the actual viewing when you hit my NFTs. But we're going to make it so that when you look at your NFT, you're showing information about the collection, the owner, and the contract address. And this information about the contract address is what people need to start learning about the collections they collect. There are a million different ways. It will be so easy to verify that on Universe. I'm going to get them to make a video on how to find that on etherscan. There needs to be way more educational content released on every project in that ledger competition. As soon as those videos are on Universe, I will show the video that won in our Universe announcements and tell everybody to watch it because it's such good information on how to stay safe in crypto.

**Mark:** We can make educational videos. We're going to wrap this up. This is 1.5 hrs, and we really shouldn't be doing these AMAs for this long because people stop watching them on YouTube. And no one wants to listen to these when they're this long, so we're going to end this, but you guys had a lot of good questions today. Let me just make sure there are no other super good questions. These are just kinds of people arguing with me. I feel like.

Dude, if people aren't checking the chain in 10 years, I don't know. We've lost all hope for humanity at this point; the Board Apes will still be losing their seed phrases. Rock, get some sleep.

**Algy:** Good 💩.

**Mark:** Thank you, everyone, for joining. We appreciate you all and go ahead.
