## Intro [[00:00]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA)

**Mark:** Hey, everyone! Welcome to project call two for kekDAO and Non-Fungible Universe. 🧙‍♂️🌌

We are excited to get back in touch with everyone and explain what we are doing. We'll jump right into it– Tyler and DMOB will talk a bit about the DAO. Tyler will begin, and DMOB will follow up on any details that Tyler has left out.

## DAO/Yield Farming [[00:26]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=26)

**Tyler:** Just in general, this will be a community-driven protocol. We'll be releasing information about the DAO because the kek token will govern the DAO. And so, most of the details around token distribution and that nature– will be released shortly. We are having, what I'm hoping, is the final call with our attorney today. At this point, many of the questions are not around token distributions or how they get distributed. It's centred around the auction mechanics.

We have DMOB with Cezar leading that effort with the DAO. The DAO will launch in close conjunction with Yield Farming. The governance of tokens will start getting distributed almost at the same time as we launch the DAO.

### kek [[01:44]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=104)

Yield Farming will be a proof of capital distribution method. There will be seven different tokens that you can utilize to yield farm kek. The thought process is– people who are both extremely active contributors, some of whom run protocols. We very much want to align with their communities for the long-term success of the project. So, we can talk about those seven tokens later.

Long story short, there are seven pools with several different tokens that you can use to farm kek tokens. Also, we will be doing an airdrop to the community members and a lot of the core contributors. And people who have were involved since the very beginning. They will be receiving tokens as well. So, there will be a pretty wide distribution from the onset. I'm not sure what else we should go over for the DAO, other than it's very similar in structure both at the interface and basic fundamental level of the BarnBridge DAO. One key change in the governance is that the kek token has annual inflation controlled by the DAO. It can be turned on or off. It can be increased or decreased to 0.

Outside of that, everything that we are doing, the fees that accrue to the DAO based on certain efforts– In aggregate, the protocol, in general, will accrue fees for the DAO. The point of the DAO and the community is not only to help with governance for the protocol. But also to help determine where the fees get sent and how they get utilized. 

**Mark:** Perfect. Thank you, Tyler. 

I think Tyler kind of mentioned some of the Yield Farming components. Troy or DMOB, would you like to expand more on the Yield Farming aspects? Or are we still a little in the gray area?

### Yield Farming [[04:29]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=269)

**Troy:** I would prefer to hand that over to DMOB. But the interesting thing about Yield Farming is the multiple types of tokens that can get farmed. That's my opinion.   

**Dragos:** Yeah, and to add the L/P with Sushi. But, the details are getting hashed out. They will be coming out soon. 

**Mark:** I think that was one of the questions in the Discord. Someone asked.

What tokens will we be able to use to farm?

I think we decided that we can share that information. 

Off the bat:

* Aave tokens
* Bond tokens
* Link tokens
* Compound tokens
* Illuvium tokens
* Synthetix Network tokens
* Sushi tokens

And as Dragos said. The kek liquidity pool gets held on Sushi, and it will most likely be a USDC/kek pool. You'll be farming kek. 

It looks similar to how the BarnBridge DAO operates. If you are farming with a few currencies you will have to claim them individually. I don't think you can claim for them all at the same time. I know people like to know about those details. 


## Characters [[06:13]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=373)

**Mark:** I'm going to hand it over to Al. He will talk to you guys about the characters that are getting created and a bit about the NFTs.

I'll let him take over.

### 69 Characters [[06:30]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=390)

**Al:** So, basically, with the characters, we have about 69 of them. We are going to stick with that number. We may split it up into separate drops of 23 characters, where it would be three drops of 23 characters. Our goal is to have a background for each character– like a lore type. 

### Comics [[06:54]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=414)

**Al:** Right now, I'm working on creating the lore for every character. For example, Ape-Ape. I'm working on a story that we are making into a comic. It's about how he goes and retrieves an item from a temple. Alike an Indiana Jones theme.  

Let me explain. Each character will have a comic that is ten pages long with two panels on each page. So, twenty panels for each story. And I have a bunch of them sketched already. Once the artists finish the art for the characters, they will move over to the comics. Then we will get sixty-nine stories done. Each a different genre, they won't be similar– they will all be different. We are going to have individual stories, and we'll make each page an NFT. I can't go into many details about how that will work. Essentially that's how we will do it. Each page will be separated.

The stories are sick. They are very compelling. Some of them are funny, and some of them are like action. I haven't done any romance yet, but I'm going to make ones that are romance. All types of genres– it'll be sick.  People are going to get into it. 

Once finished with that, I'll expand the lore on the characters that people enjoy– even more on the planets. I already have a bunch wrote before I started the comics. I was already getting into that. But now, I've switched over to the comics– I'm doing them every day. 

I try and get at least one story done each day. But, sometimes I get writer's block, you know? It's going pretty well so far.

**Tyler:** Nice! 

One thing, so the community understands what's going on with the stories. I believe I touched on this on the last community call. 

Essentially, we will have what we call 'core drops.'  The best way to describe them is as a cron job. The DAO will outsource the creation of stories to the core team. They will not always be stories. However, they will always be NFT drops. So, we will code some of the frameworks for how to launch good comic drops on-chain.

We are also working with the Lime Chain team on two versions of what we call 'polymorphic' NFTs. I don't want to get into details. Because we tend to have people that front runs us on ideas. However, I will say it won't be anything similar to the first drop. Every single drop that we do will get released in creative commons– for the content. So people can use it. We will also open-source the code, so, If people want to come and drop a game on our platform or a comic book on our platform. We will provide the framework, so it is easier to do that. The more core drops we do– the more fees come back to the treasury. Also, at scale, we will have loads of materials for artists to come on and start playing with. 

**Mark:** Tyler makes a lot of good points. Almost everything that we will be doing– if we are doing a core drop. We will use as many tools built on kekDAO as possible to show you the platform's possibilities, even with the comics. We will have social galleries. If you own all ten pages of one comic, then you have a slideshow of the comic. You can play it. If you have all ten pages, it's like watching an NFT comic book on your computer. You wouldn't have to change the pages. 

Although, it seems as if we are simply making comics. There is a much larger picture here with what we are doing. We want to build this ecosystem of tools for artists to create their creations. And, if you wish to do something with some of our characters like Darrell. Then we encourage that. We want people to be making short films, fan art, fiction and more stories about Darrell. Because it creates more hype for the character, then we know people like it. That's the main thing. We want to show that this platform builds up characters, communities and NFTs. It allows you to share your love for NFTs. 

I think we covered a lot on the characters.
 

## Whitepaper/Docs [[12:46]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=766)

**Mark:** Tyler, do you want to talk about the white paper or the docs? 

I know people are ready for the docs. 

### When? [[12:57]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=777)

**Tyler:** Yeah, as I said– we have to have a final sign-off with the attorney on a couple of points. I wouldn't suggest we deprioritized getting that done. It's more that we have prioritized code and releasing everything. So, I don't want there to be an impression that we are spending a lot of time planning everything. We've been building, and there is a lot done on the react application and all of the designs. So, it is coming together. 

### Updates [[13:30]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=810)

In terms of announcements, I've erred on the side of making sure everything is bulletproof before we start releasing information. When it does start to come out, it will come at rapid-fire. Because, we will drop the whitepaper– which will very much be a lite paper. We'll also start releasing the DAO information and the Yield Farming information. The 'what is the Universe & kekDAO' articles. 

So, long story short, the docs are coming. And when they start to come– there will be a lot of them subsequently.  

**Mark:** Well, that's exciting news. I know everyone is excited by the docs, and they've been freaking out in the Discord about it. 


## Community Questions [[14:32]](https://youtu.be/JAZOA0ibCVA?t=872)

**Mark:** It looks like we have a fair amount of questions from the Discord. The main inquiry appears to be "When docs?" and we answered that. We answered the Yield Farming questions. 

The other frequent question that I see on the Discord; 

> "When are we going to be able to mint NFTs or create a collection on the platform?"

**Tyler:** I would suggest some of that will be up to the DAO. We need to come up with a framework for approvals. But the answer is– the majority will likely be managed in the Discord to start. People who have been super supportive of the project early on, if they have a quality drop, we won't shy away from it. We want people launching quality things on our platform. I don't want to give out concrete timelines for when everything launches. 

But, I'll say, you will all know the answers to those questions around the time you need to know the answers. Meaning, you will know, before we launch the auction platform, how we will handle everything. I know I'm giving a vague answer. But, that's the most information I have at the moment.

**Mark:** I think that's sort of sufficient. But we'll take whatever we can get at this point.

One last question: 

> "Are there any plans for partnerships with artists for the upcoming launch?"

I think I can answer that. Currently, we have a few artists that are involved with the project. Justin Blau, RAC, Dillon Francis. We have a few known artists. I don't think they will be exclusive to kekDAO or anything like that. However, we are talking to artists and pitching kekDAO & Non-Fungible Universe to them. And all the tools that they will have access to everything from community building to NFTs, minting & custom (ERC) tokens.

So, the answer is yes. We are hoping– and we are already talking to artists. We will not say who is dropping. But, big-name artists are releasing on the platform. There are people with a lot of connections– who know influential artists in the NFT space. I would expect people to be using our platform, even our small names. We have a lot of smaller artists that we want to port over. Because we think their communities are critical.


**Tyler:** Yep. Even with one of our co-founders Tim. With his seven grants program. He has spent the last month vetting artists that he will be giving grants to for his program. He has pretty substantial backers aside from general clout in the NFT space. But, I would say, through the investor network and the 'brain-trust.' We have had top-level and even media companies asking us about what we are doing.  

The same as everyone else:

* When is this launching?
* Where are the docs?
* What is Universe?

One of the reasons we have been a little guarded is because we are expecting a flood gate. The people on Twitter and the Discord community are not the only ones awaiting information on this. 

**Mark:** Also, on the other side of– Are there reputable artists coming to NFU and kekDAO? There are also known collectors. Whale Shark and GMoney are investors in the project. I'm sure they will be trying to port over their communities. Whale Shark has an amazing community. The whale community! I'm sure a lot of people know about that in the NFT space. I think large collectors are just as important as large artists. 

Even people who don't own NFTs, I make a strong point about this. Artists, collectors, viewers, admirers and owners are all very important to the space of art and NFTs. Because you don't need to own an NFT or a piece of art to admire it, and they do create economies. The reason museums are a thing– is because people admire art. There are groups sometimes who want exclusives, but with NFTs in this equation, everyone is important. KekDAO wants to bring everyone into that equation. It doesn't matter what group you fit into– if you like NFTs. We hope the kekDAO provides value for you. 

So, I think that's all we got.

Does anyone want to add anything to this call? 

I know it's somewhat of a shorter call. But, we are still limited by what we can put out in the air. 

**Tyler:** Yep. 

**Mark:** Probably in two weeks, we should have more to say. 

**Tyler:** Yes, by the next call. I'm looking through these questions. 

Someone asked about a private round– that's over. We finished that a while ago. 

> "How should artists and individuals with original IP that plan on launching on your platform contact your team?"

Discord is a great place. I talked about this on a prior call our DAO and platform do not manage IP. The intellectual property gets managed off-chain. It's up to the company or the artist. Whoever puts it on the platform has to understand how that works.

There is no testnet at this time. But we will launch one when everything is up and running.  

In terms of the tokens that we launch with Yield Farming, it's several founder's and investors' tokens. Because a lot of our communities have overlapped with announcements, so, Bond will naturally be one. Sushi– because 0xmaki is pretty involved in this project. We are using sushi swap as the L/P for liquidity. It's also one of the tokens you can farm. Compound because Robert is active in the project and Aave because Stani is engaged in the project. Chainlink is one because we love the link marines, and they likely have the strongest community in crypto. Also, Chainlink god was extremely supportive of this project early on. Sythetix with Kain and Jordan– honestly, the whole Synthetix team has been proactively helpful in this. And his brothers started an NFT project called Illuvium. They both invested in this project, and there is overlap. They want to release an Illuvium drop on our platform. There is quite a bit of synergy, even though I don't want to say it because I hate that word– but it is what it is. 

I'm not sure if I went over all of them: **Bond, Sushi, Synthetix, Illuvium, Aave, Compound & Link**. Those are the seven tokens to start.  


**Mark:** There is one question about land. So, with land NFTs, we are not doing that for a while. We would like to make games and metaverses in the future. But, that is not on our roadmap at the moment. The first items on our list to build are these tools. 

I may be better able to answer that in the future. I don't know if our minting function will allow you to mint land. I'm not sure how that works.

**Tyler:** I don't know how the land NFTs work. But, virtual reality is a whole other animal. Maybe downstream when the project is very successful– the core drops could get quite complex. Other groups are doing cool stuff with metaverse and virtual reality. I don't want to compete with them at that game. We have the core competencies that we are good at, and I think that's where we focus. 

**Mark:** Yeah, there are some well built out metaverses already. Like [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/). If you have not seen those. I'd go and play around on them and check out the metaverses.

I think that is all we have for this project call. Thank you guys for joining us!

And join us again in two weeks, on Thursday!

**Dragos:** Thank you!

**Everyone:** 👋👋👋👋
